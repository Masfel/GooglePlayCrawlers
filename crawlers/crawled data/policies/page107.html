                        <p>
                            According to European Commission, Personal Data is any information that relates to an <b>identified</b> or <b>identifiable</b> living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We collect, use, disclose and process Personal Data in line with this Privacy Policy, for the purposes of provision of Services, which includes but is not limited to development and improvement of the Services and also our business; of advertising and marketing; and to provide you with innovational fitness and wellness services, and for other purposes described further below.

                        <p>
                            We may exclude certain data components, such as your name and email address that makes the data personally identifiable to you, from your Personal Data and create an unidentifiable or anonymous data; the usage of which would not be subject to this Privacy Policy.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="what-the-user-should-know-at-a-glance">How We Collect Your Information</h2>

                        <p>In order to provide you with our Services, we need certain information about you. This information is often shared with us directly by you, such as your responses to the questions we ask, but we also collect your personal data from certain third parties, such as the information we collect from social media platforms you connect with the Website and/or the App. There is also certain data we collect automatically, like the operating system of your mobile device and the sections of our App you mostly interact with or spend time using.</p>

                        <h2 id="what-the-user-should-know-at-a-glance">The Information We Collect Directly from You</h2>

                        <p>
                            We ask you for certain personal information, such as your name, surname, email address and password (<b>“Profile Data”</b>), when you are setting up your profile.
                        </p>

                        <p>We also ask for some other information, such as your gender, fitness background, age, weight and height (<b>"Physiological Data"</b>).

                        <p>
                            In order to provide you with our Services and for other purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, we may need to share your Personal Data with third parties as described below.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We take every precaution to ensure such third parties provide all appropriate technical and also administrative measures, identical to or equal to those required from us, before transferring your information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may transfer your information to the servers outside the country of your domicile, when needed, provided that all measures are taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where possible, we anonymize or pseudonymize your information, before sharing, and in that case, we can disclose or use your aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose. De-identified Data means data where we have removed information like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows the third parties to provide their services without being able to match such data with you. We do this to ensure your personal data is protected.
                        </p>
                        <p>

We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints (together, <b>“Data Collection Tools”</b>), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. <b> We would like to remind you that we do not share any of your Personal Data related to your health, motion and fitness, and any information gained through the HealthKit framework or Google Fit SDK with third parties for marketing and advertising purposes.</b>
