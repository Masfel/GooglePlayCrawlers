<p dir="ltr">3. Our Legal Basis for Processing Data</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to process your personal data, we will rely upon the legal bases afforded by applicable laws and regulations. In addition to your consent, which will always be limited to specific processing activities and include relevant, detailed information required for you to fully understand what you are consenting to, these legal bases may also include our compliance with legal obligations, the performance of an agreement with you, our legitimate interests, the prevention of fraud and your security, among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Data Storage and Transfer</p>
<p dir="ltr">(1) We may store your data in the territory of your residence country or region or overseas, including in the cloud. We apply our global data standards and policies wherever your data is stored.</p>
