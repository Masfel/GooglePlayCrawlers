            <p>

                ACR does not collect or transfer any data to us or to any third party unless stated below.
            </p>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <h4>Translate this page</h4>
            <div id="google_translate_element"></div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h4>Microphone access</h4>
            <p>
                ACR must use your phone's microphone and call audio source to record calls.
                <br>
                ACR does not automatically collect or transfer any audio or voice data to us or to any third party. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Naturally, if you use cloud services it will have to transfer the recording of your calls to the cloud service of your choice</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>



            <h4>Contacts access</h4>
            <p>
                ACR uses your contacts to match recordings to contacts and display recording
                information under contact names. It also uses contacts to apply recording and listing filters you might select. ACR does not collect or transfer any contact data to us or to any third party. Naturally, if you use cloud services it will have to transfer contact name in the recording file name to the cloud service of your choice.
                <br>
                ACR does not automatically collect or transfer any contact information to us or to any third party.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>


            <h4>Auto Email (AE)</h4>
            <p>
                AE is an optional premium future of ACR. It requires you to save your email address and login details in ACR settings, which, is only accessible to ACR and is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ACR uses stored login information to auto login to your email provider's system and sends your last recording (like an email app) from your email service to the email address you specify in AE settings or communicate with your email provider's mail service.
                If you are not comfortable with above, you can always use Auto Email (Gmail) and setup auto email without giving out your details.
                <br>
                ACR does not automatically collect or transfer any account information to us or to any third party.

            </p>
      
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>



            <h4> WebDAV</h4>
            <p>
                WebDAV is a standard HTTP protocol to transfer files from clients to servers. WebDAV is an optional premium future of ACR. It requires you to save your login details for your webserver or WebDAV service in ACR settings, which is only accessible to ACR and it is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ACR uses stored login information to auto login to your WebDAV service and upload your recordings.
                <br>
                ACR does not automatically collect or transfer any account information to us or to any third party.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <h4> FTP</h4>
            <p>
                FTP is a file transfer protocol to transfer files from clients to servers. FTP is an optional premium future of ACR. It requires you to save your login details for your FTP service in ACR settings that, is only accessible to ACR and it is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ACR uses stored login information to auto login to your FTP server and upload your recordings.
                <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>


            <h4>
                Other cloud services
            </h4>
            <p>
                ACR supports other cloud services such as Dropbox and Google drive.  These services are being accessed if and when user links their account with ACR. Due to nature of linking and access, ACR can only access certain areas of the cloud service and these are clearly explained to user during authorisation request by the cloud service.

                ACR uses given authorisation to upload and store your recordings on the cloud service and can delete or re-upload recordings on your request within ACR cloud services setting.
                <br>
                ACR does not automatically collect or transfer any account information to us or to any third party.

            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;

            <h4>
                Advertising
            </h4>
            <p>

            <h4>
                Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
            </h4>
            <p>
                FCM is part of the core of the Android and used by Google and developers to communicate with your phone via Google services. If you choose to receive updates within ACR settings, ACR uses FCM to deliver notifications about updates and promotions related to ACR, to you. In order to do that we store a very long random string of text that is unique to ACR.  This information does not contain any personal information whatsoever and cannot be used anywhere apart from ACR. It is deleted as soon as you are opt-out from receiving updates under ACR settings.
                You can read more about FCM at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/">https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/</a>

                <br> <br>
                ACR uses Firebase Analytics to collect information about how many people install and use it. You can turn of Analytics data collection under ACR settings.
