Together the Game(s), and Website are referred to as the “<strong>Online Services</strong>”.</p>



<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at dzkdes@gmail.com</p>



<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. The Privacy Policy explains the basis on which personal information we collect from you will be processed by us or on our behalf. Where we decide the purpose or means for which personal data you supply through these Online Services is processed, we are the “data controller.” We will comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679.</p>



<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about the following:</p>



<ul><li>What information we may collect about you;</li><li>How we will use information we collect about you;</li><li>Whether we will disclose your details to anyone else; and</li><li>Your choices and rights regarding the personal information you have provided to us.</li></ul>



<p>This Privacy Policy forms a part of and should be read in conjunction with our terms of use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Online Services may contain hyperlinks to services owned and operated by third parties. These third party services may have their own privacy policies and we recommend that you review them.

<ol><li><strong>c)</strong><strong>Information collected for the purposes of providing analytics</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong>(“Analytics”)</strong></p>



<p>We may collect technical information about your use of the Online Services through the use of tracking technologies and analytics.</p>

We will also receive technical data in order to ensure the Games connect to the correct Facebook account.</p>



<ol><li><strong>WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</strong></li></ol>



<ol><li><strong>a)</strong><strong>To provide our Games to you</strong></li></ol>



<p>We will use information about you (including Basic Information, Third Party Log In Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering our Games to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in this way is necessary for us to record your progress and current status within a Game, and to ensure the Games deliver the features promised and function properly, so that you have the best experience when playing any one of our Games.</p>



<ol><li><strong>b)</strong><strong>To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems</strong></li></ol>



<p>We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User Content and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online Services.</p>



<p>This processing is also necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of (i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly so that you and other users have the best experience when playing any of our Game(s) and using the other Online Services; (ii) improving the quality of our Online Services, and providing a better experience to our users; (iii) identifying and correcting any bugs in the Games and Online Services and iv) understanding the effectiveness of our marketing to attract new users and re-engage our current users at an aggregated level.</p>



<ol><li><strong>d)</strong><strong>To acquire new users and engage current users</strong></li></ol>



<p>We may process information (including some Advertising Data and Analytics) to encourage engagement from our less active users and to notify them with new virtual items or other promotions on offer.</p>



<p>We may also process this information to pursue our legitimate interests of acquiring new users for our Games.</p>



<p>We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users. The information we collect about you may be used to improve the relevancy of our marketing, including the creation of ‘lookalike’ audiences. This allows us to offer more relevant marketing to potential new service users without using information that personally identifies you.</p>



<ol><li><strong>e)</strong><strong>To improve the monetisation of the Games via in-app purchases</strong></li></ol>



<p>We may process information (including Basic Information, User Content, Advertising Data and Analytics) to understand how users use our Games, and to compile statistical reports regarding that activity, as well as understanding how users progress, and their current status within a Game. This processing is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving the Games and increasing the amount of revenue generated via in-app purchases. This may include the implementation of dynamic pricing models, so that in-app purchases are priced according to relevant factors, such as geography and gameplay progression so that we can offer temporary promotional discounts.</p>



<ol><li><strong>f)</strong><strong>For advertising purposes</strong></li></ol>



<p>We may process Advertising Data to show you advertisements for third party services; including advertising that may reward you with benefits during your use of the Games.</p>



<p>The information we collect about you may be used to understand how advertisements placed in our Games have performed or how many people have viewed certain advertisements. We aggregate this information so that it does not personally identify you or permit you to be treated individually.</p>



<p>We may also use this information to reward users with benefits that can be used for further enjoyment of the Games from the viewing of certain advertising placed in our Games.</p>



<p>We will not pass or process your information for the purposes of marketing by third parties unless you give your consent should we ask for it. After you have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.</p>



<p>We may use the information we collect about you to serve you targeted advertisements in our Games. We do this to provide you with more relevant advertising content. We work with the following third party advertising networks :</p>



<ul><li>Chartboost –&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/115001489623">https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/115001489623</a></li><li>Adcolony –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adcolony.com/privacy-policy/">https://www.adcolony.com/privacy-policy/</a></li><li>Facebook –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation</a></li><li>Unity –&nbsp;<a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li><li>Google –&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li></ul>



<p>If you would like to find out more about the way these third parties collect and process your information please refer to their respective privacy policies and/or terms and conditions by clicking on the links provided above.</p>



<ol><li><strong>g)</strong><strong>To prevent fraud and illegal activity</strong></li></ol>



<p>We process personal data for our legitimate interests of ensuring that any use of the Online Services is lawful and non-fraudulent, does not disrupt the operation of our services, does not harass our staff or other individuals, to enforce our legal rights and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>



<p>Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws or our terms of use, we may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your law enforcement agencies about the content.</p>



<p>We reserve the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. You may not copy, download, or embed any User Content without the express written permission of the content owner. You may not use any User Content for any commercial purposes, or any public performances.</p>



<p>We work with Apple and Google to assist us with fraud prevention and the detection of any illegal activity (e.g. to verify in-app purchases made through iTunes and Google Play).</p>



<ol><li><strong>DATA SHARING</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>



<p>Group members, personnel, suppliers or subcontractors: We keep your information confidential, but may disclose it to any member of our group (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006), our personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the information, and have agreed to safeguard it.</p>



<p>Merger or acquisition: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any third party to which we sell or transfer our assets to will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>Required by law: In addition, we may disclose your information to the extent that we are required to do so by law (which may include to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).</p>



<p>Enforcement: We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in order to enforce or apply the terms of agreements, to investigate potential breaches, or to protect the rights, property or safety of FFG, our customers, or others.</p>



<p>Digital Content Stores: Where the Games are downloaded through Google Play, iTunes and/or Amazon Appstore, we may disclose your personal information to Google, Apple and/or Amazon respectively for the purposes of facilitating any in-Game payments made through these platforms.</p>



<ol><li><strong>AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong>We may use automated decision making methods which do not involve human involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>



<p>We may process your personal information via automated decision making methods in order to identify users who are suspected of cheating in the Games. Our automated decision making methods are designed to detect cheating by looking out for (i) excessive currency stores against actual completed gameplay; and (ii) excessive content against actual purchases made and completed gameplay.</p>



<p>If users are determined to be or suspected of cheating the following actions may be taken and which will be unknown to the user:</p>



<ul><li>an increase in the number of advertisements displayed within the Games; and</li><li>an increase in the frequency of suspected cheats playing against other suspected cheats.</li></ul>



<p>We may block users from the Games and/or the Online Services who are determined to be cheating following an automated decision process. In this scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision to block access to the Games and/or the Online Services.</p>



<ol><li><strong>CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you do not wish to be part of a lookalike campaign, receive notifications from us or be served with targeted advertisements you can opt-out by changing your advertising and notification settings on your device directly.</p>



<p>You can withdraw your consent to targeted advertising by changing your advertising settings on your device at any time.</p>
