        <p>
            I (developper of the games) do not collect, process or store any data from the user. I never ask for a login or password and the user never gives me any personal data.
            However, my games runs on the Unity game engine and uses Unity Ads plugin. These products are made by Unity Technologies. Unity Technologies collects
            data from the users of Unity games, such as my games.
