In the case of any material change in the Policy, we will post the new Policy on the "Website" or notify you of the same via the "Whoscall Applications". We suggest that you should view the "Policy" periodically with a view to confirming whether any change in the Policy takes place.</p> <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2> <p>Unless otherwise provided in the "Policy", the terms used in the "Policy" shall have the meaning as defined in the "Company" Terms of Service.</p> <h3 id="data-collected-and-usage">1. Data Collected and Usage</h3> <p><strong>Data collected by the “Company”.</strong> The "Company" will collect data from the "Whoscall User", “Whoscall Visitor”, “Third Party Database”, “Search Engine Database” and “User Generated Content” to make the same available to the "Website" and "Whoscall Service" or for any other usage agreed by you in the service terms and conditions for upgrading efficiency and optimizing or improving the “Whoscall Service”, and, insofar as it is permitted under the service terms and conditions, for any other purposes consistent with protection of personal data and privacy. The data collected by the "Company" include but are not limited to "User Data " and "Caller ID", as well as the “communication and equipment marking data” accessed from the communication equipment applied by you. "User Data" means the information stored in your phone which is transmitted via your operating system and browser per access authority, and information you choose to be uploaded to the "Whoscall Service" upon your consent to the User Experience Optimization of "Whoscall Service" intended to improve and develop related services, including but not limited to your own phone number and search logs or block logs, marks or notes about the calls related to or connected with you, the GPS site or communication service quality presumed or judged by the system independently via your access to the “Whoscall Service”, and the search log of the keywords you might use in the "Whoscall Service" and your purchase history in the Service.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in order to identify the Whoscall visitors visiting or accessing your device, you will have to submit your contact person list, favorites list and blocklist, in order to help the "Whoscall Service" provide feedback to you immediately for search and identification of the caller ID. Further, when the “Whoscall user” feeds back any problem about the program and reflects any related matters via the “Report other problem” or other transmission functions in the “Whoscall App”, the “Whoscall Service” would use the personal information and private messages submitted by the user here (including but not limited to, the device information, call log and messages, et al.), as the important reference for investigation and shooting of existing trouble, improvement on the basic service quality, and future research and development of new functions.</p> <p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> In order to fully utilize the core services of Whoscall, you must first agree to share contact information such as names and numbers. This can assist us to activate the caller identity finder function and optimize our anti-spam services. We will never divulge any of your personal information outside of Whoscall services. Whoscall is liable for the security of user data, as a result we utilize double encryption technology: AES, a symmetric encryption algorithm on the user end, and SSL encrypted sessions during data transfer. All of your provided user information will be compiled into anonymous statistical analysis data that are not identifiable. We are very stringent with user data and will protect your privacy and security at all costs. Whoscall will never illegally sell or disclose your data to third parties outside of Whoscall services. Certain permissions are only requested to provide a better and more robust product service. You can cancel and refuse to continue providing any permissions at any time you wish, but the full scope of product services will be limited as a result.</p> <p>"Caller ID" means the contents submitted via your choice (including but not limited to the information you submit to us voluntarily) and any other information you provide to Gogolook for the ID of a "Whoscall User". You agree that "the Company" may review and read the "Caller ID SMS Format" in your phone, in order to provide you with the information about the telecommunication operator which provides services to your caller. Said data will be displayed on the "Whoscall Caller ID" in the form of your phone number, including but not limited to, your name, phone number and any other contact information you provide.</p> <h3 id="section">2.</h3> <p>The "Company" will collect data from the "Whoscall User" to make the same available to the "Website" and "Whoscall Service" for upgrading efficiency, and allow the "Member" and "Non-registered User" to manage and use the "Whoscall Service". The data collected by the "Company" include "User Data " and "Caller ID".</p> <p>In the process of your use of the "Whoscall Service", the data which the "Company" will ask to provide will include some data which would be identified as "Personal Data". "Personal Data" include but are not limited to your name, phone number, email box, credit card number or other debit note information, as well as your home address and email address. Some "Personal Data" must be provided for the use of the "Whoscall Service", but you may also choose to provide additional "Personal Data" in your personal "Whoscall Caller ID Data". You understand that when you fail to provide some "Personal Data" as required, the "Whoscall Service" will not be able to perform the Service function, in whole or in part.</p> <p>The "Company" might ask you for the “communication and equipment marking data” collected or processed upon your agreement to the service terms and conditions or any information related to you other than your “personal data”, e.g. your postal code and personal preference, which are generally identified as "Non-identifiable Data", as such data per se cannot afford to identify your ID expressly. Notwithstanding, if the "Non-identifiable Data" may be combined in the manner sufficient to identify your ID directly or indirectly (e.g. combination of your street number and postal code), the relevant data will be identified as a part of your "Personal Data"</p> <p>The "Company" use your "Personal Data" (under some circumstances, combined with "Non-identifiable Data") in order to provide the "Whoscall Service" and respond to your search primarily. Further, you agree that the “Company” may compile and conclude the “anonymous statistic analysis data” from the “de-identified” personal data and “non-identifiable data”, with the authorization under the service terms and conditions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we also might use your "Personal Data" and "Non-identifiable Data" to combine them with the data collected from the other "Whoscall Users" in the internal system, and use, or provide a third party with the access to, the “anonymous statistic analysis data” which cannot afford to identify the concerned party, with the authorization under the service terms and conditions, in order to provide you with better experience, or enhance the Whoscall quality and help you understand how to use our services, or be dedicated to providing you with specific services, e.g. mailing of administration notices to you, or supply of products to you depending on your personal preference or restrictions.</p> <p><strong>Technical Data.</strong> When you access the "Website" or interact with some service provided by us, or you are provided with or fed back some open information by the Company upon your access to the "Whoscall Service", as a "Registered User", "Non-registered User" or "Whoscall Visitor", our server will automatically record some data received or transmitted upon your access to the “Whoscall Service” or due to the “Whoscall Service”, so that we might collect the service information derived from the instruction about your access to or receipt of the information via the “Whoscall Service”, or kept or recorded upon your access to any other items provided by the “Whoscall Service”, provided that said service information will be collected in the form of “unidentifiable data”. By so doing, the "Company" may improve the "Whoscall Service" and also ensure that the Service may be available to you and meet your personal preference.
