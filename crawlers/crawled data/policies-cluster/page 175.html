        <p class="text-center">Last updated: January 12, 2021</p>



        <p>Rave Inc. ("Rave", "Company", "we", and "us") respects the privacy of its users ("you") and has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, process, transfer, store, and disclose your information whenever you use or interact with us through websites, mobile applications, any of our online products and services and links (collectively, the “Services”). In addition, agreements or notices associated with a particular Rave product, service, software or website (“Rave Offering”) may provide additional information about Rave’s processing of your personal information (“Notice”). By using our Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>



        <p><b>1. Information we collect about you</b></p>



        <p>a) <b>In General:</b> Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (as defined by applicable privacy or data protection laws).

In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Services, or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and if you transact business with us, financial information, and content and information you post, upload, publish, link to, transmit, record, display or otherwise make available on the Services, or transmit to other users, including text messages, chat, videos (including streaming videos), photographs, or profile text, whether publicly or privately transmitted or posted.

        <p>b) <b>Personal Information:</b> We do not disclose your personal information with others except as specified in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and provide you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information disclosed.

We may also disclose your information, including personal information in order to protect or defend the rights, property or safety of our Company, our users, our employees, or others, or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies. In the event of the sale of all or a portion of Rave’s assets, Rave may provide personal information to the third party purchaser.</p>



        <p>c) <b>Aggregated and/or non-personal information</b>: We may use and disclose non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also disclose it with third parties to help develop or deliver targeted advertising on our Services.

        <p><b>5. How you can access your information</b></p>



        <p>If you have a Rave account you can review and update your personal information under the "Settings" page in the Rave application. You may close your account at any time by deleting the Rave application from your mobile device. In the event you close your account, we may retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes, recordkeeping, enforce our Terms of Use or any other policies or agreements, to prevent fraud, or take any actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, any information that has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, will be subject to those third parties' policies regarding retention of information. Rave retains personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of Rave's identified purposes or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable laws. When personal information is no longer necessary or relevant for Rave’s identified purposes, or required by applicable laws, Rave will take steps to have it deleted, destroyed, erased, aggregated or made anonymous. </p>



        <p><b>6. Your choices regarding collection and use of your information</b></p>



        <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information in the registration process, but that may result in you being unable to access or use certain features of our Service because that information may be necessary in order to register as a user. If you do not wish to login into our Services using your Facebook login, you will be unable to use the Services.</p>



        <p><b>7. How we protect your information</b></p>



        <p>Security measures are used to help safeguard your personal information and prevent unauthorized access, use, and/or disclosure. However, no system is completely secure therefore you are advised to take steps to protect your information. Rave does not promise, nor should it be expected from you, that your personal information, chat, or other communications will always remain secure. Users of our Services should take care whenever personal information is disclosed when using or accessing our Services. You can reduce risk of unauthorized access to your personal information by using common sense security practices. For example, you are responsible for utilizing appropriate security measures to control access to your device and computer system, such as creating a strong password that cannot be easily guessed by others (e.g. by including punctuation marks, numbers, capital and lowercase letters, and choosing a password of an appropriate length and which does not include your name or account name), using different passwords for different services and using up-to-date antivirus software.</p>



        <p><b>8. Children's Privacy</b></p>



        <p>Our Services are restricted to use by individuals age 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>



        <p><b>9. No Rights of Third Parties</b></p>



        <p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties.</p>



        <p><b>10. You can access your personal information</b></p>



        <p>Upon written request, Rave will inform you whether or not it holds personal information about you and provide you with access to your information within a reasonable timeframe and at minimal or no cost in accordance with applicable laws. If you identify an inaccuracy or incompleteness in your personal information, Rave will amend your information and notify any third parties as required by applicable laws.</p>



        <p>In certain situations and depending on applicable laws, Rave may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that it holds about you. For example, Rave may not provide access to information if doing so: (i) would likely reveal personal information about a third party; (ii) could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual; (iii) would reveal Rave or third party confidential information; (iv) includes information that is protected by solicitor or attorney client privilege; (v) or includes information that was processed in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law.</p>



        <p>In order to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, Rave may ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your personal information.</p>



        <p>Depending on the circumstances and applicable laws, Rave may refuse to process certain access requests (e.g. access requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, would be extremely impractical or require disproportionate technical effort).</p>



        <p><b>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>



        <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted with a "last revised date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our Privacy Policy from time to time to inform yourself of any changes to this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies or agreements. You will be deemed to have agreed to any such modification or amendment by your decision to continue using the Services following the date in which the modified or amended Privacy Policy is posted.</p>



        <p>Rave will occasionally update this Privacy Policy so that it remains relevant and current with changing technologies, applicable laws, our evolving business practices and the needs of our users. Rave encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of how Rave manages your personal information. If any changes are made to this Privacy Policy, Rave will revise the "Last Updated" date that is indicated on the Privacy Policy.</p>



        <p>If material changes are made that impact you, we will notify users by placing a prominent notice at http://rave.io/privacy.html. Depending on the circumstances, we may also decide to send users a notice electronically. If you continue to use your Rave Offerings after notice of the change has been given, you will be deemed to have accepted such changes.</p>
