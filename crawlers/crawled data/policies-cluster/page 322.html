<p class="title">Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how our app deals with the personal identifiable information ('PII') you may occasionally provide to us via Internet (the Google Play Platform).
</p>

<p>Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download our Android applications. To be specific, we do not require the consumers to get registered before downloading the application</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.<br><br>
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
We collect non PII like 1DM+ app package name, app version, cpu arch, country and a unique device identifier to save/download important settings (A notification will be shown with title as Syncing or Syncing settings).<br><br>
The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you personally decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report. The PII we may get from you in that situation are strictly limited to your name, email address, device information and your feedback response only.<br><br>
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.<br><br>

In above situation, we guarantee that your PII will only be used for contacting you and improving our services.
