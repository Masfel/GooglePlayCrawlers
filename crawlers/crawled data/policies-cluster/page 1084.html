<p><strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Mobile Device Identifiers, and Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (‚ÄúTechnologies‚Äù) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors‚Äô device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.</p>
<p><em>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</em>. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about users‚Äô engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</p>
<p><em>Mobile Device Identifiers</em>. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Google Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device. In some cases, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID.</p>
<p><em>Analytics</em>. We may also use Google Analytics to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</a> You can opt out of Google‚Äôs collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p><em>Performance Related</em>. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;</p>
<p><em>Functionality Related</em>. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;</p>

<p>You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. To separately make choices for mobile apps on a mobile device, you can download the DAA‚Äôs AppChoices application from your device‚Äôs app store. In addition, for some devices you may use your device‚Äôs platform controls in your settings to exercise choice (e.g., <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">iOS</a><u>, and </u><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/">others</a>).

<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>, <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/choices/">https://youradchoices.ca/choices/</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners‚Äô use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Retention Period</strong></p>

<p><strong id="ChildPrivacy">Children‚Äôs Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Protecting children‚Äôs privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children.</p>
<p>For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the user‚Äôs age. For these services, when a user indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts. We also limit Personal Data collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns regarding the service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@jamcity.com">privacy@jamcity.com</a>. If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete any Personal Data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child‚Äôs account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.</p>
