<p>EVOLLY.APP PTE. LTD. (“we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy (“Privacy policy”) explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you install and/or use EVOLLYAPP software application for mobile devices (the “App”, “our App”).</p>



<p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data.</p>



<p>It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.</p>



<p>Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”).</p>



<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated.</p>



<h3>IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT NOTICE</h3>



<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) California residents shall have the right to request:</p>



<ul><li>the categories of personal information that is processed;</li><li>the categories of sources from which personal information is obtained;</li><li>the purpose for processing of user personal data;</li><li>the categories of third parties with whom we may share your personal information;</li><li>the specific pieces of personal information that we might have obtained about particular user provided that the data given in the request is reliable enough and allows to identify the user.</li></ul>



<p>Please use the navigation links through this Privacy Policy:</p>



<p>PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>



<p>All about the categories of information, its sources and purposes of processing&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>Please mind that according to CCPA personal information does not include de-identified or aggregated consumer information.</p>



<p>SHARING</p>



<p>How your information can be shared&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>Please note that all third parties that are engaged in processing user data are service providers that&nbsp; use such information on the basis of agreement and pursuant to business purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OPT-OUT OPTIONS</p>



<p>If you don’t want us to process your personal information any more please contact us through &nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@evolly.app">support@evolly.app</a>. In most cases there is no way to maintain the App’s further operating without functional data therefore you will be advised to remove the App from your device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t want us to share device identifiers and geolocation data with service providers please check your device settings to opt out as described below&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>REQUESTS</p>



<p>To submit a verifiable consumer request for access, portability or deletion personal data please contact us through email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@evolly.app">support@evolly.app</a>. Please include in the text of your appeal the wording “Your rights to maintain confidentiality in the state of California”.</p>



<p>When submitting a verifiable request, you should be ready to:&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: name, address, city, state, and zip code and email address. We may use this information to surface a series of security questions to you to verify your identity. If you are making a request through an authorized agent acting on your behalf, such authorized agent must provide written authorization confirming or a power of attorney, signed by you.</p>



<p>• Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will not be able to respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot: (i) verify your identity or authority to make the request; or (ii) confirm the personal information relates to you. We may ask you for additional information or documents to verify your identity. We may also carry out checks, including with third party identity verification services, to verify your identity before taking any action with your personal information. This is regarded as a safeguard measure to prevent disclosure of your personal information under a fake or scum request.</p>



<p>We ensure that personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request will be used only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request and not for any other purpose. We will keep it for the adequate term reasonably needed for the purpose described above and delete after the purpose is fulfilled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Please note that we are only required to respond to two requests per customer each year.</p>



<p>EQUAL RIGHTS</p>



<p>Nothing in the way we deal with your request shall be interpreted as discrimination, which means that we will not set up different pricing or products, or different level or quality of services for you, if you choose to exercise your rights. However, in some circumstances, we may not be able to provide services if you choose to delete your personal information from our records.</p>

<p>There are several categories of information that can be processed.</p>



<p><strong>Functional Information&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We ask for and process the following personal information when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate&nbsp;<strong>performance of the contract</strong>&nbsp;between you and us. Without such information it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Activity Information&nbsp;</strong>directly related to your use of the App. We may have technical access to your camera roll required to analyze the document info (file format, number of pages, etc) and available instruments for document editing. However, we cannot collect, store or use the data contained in your camera roll.</li></ul>



<p>All scanned documents are stored locally on your device, they are inaccessible either to us or to any third party. Only you can share documents to certain party by exporting them through the App.</p>

<p><strong>Information That Is Processed Automatically</strong></p>



<p>When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form.

If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the features of the App.</p>



<p>We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent by your device via our App (advertising or analytics tools). Some of them launch automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described below). Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you first time launch the App.</p>
