                            <p>Many of our mobile apps offer additional purchaseable content as In-App Purchases. When an In-App Purchase is requested, all relevant account information is sent to the store provider (Apple, Google, or Amazon) to complete the purchase, and this information is not collected by us.</p>
                            <p>For children using our mobile apps, parents and guardians should be aware that they can prevent unwanted purchases by requiring a password before in-app purchases can be made. Parents and guardians are responsible for maintaining security on their devices, as the store providers will not always honor refunds for purchases when proper security is not followed. </p>
                            <p>You can learn how to secure your device and prevent unwanted in-app purchases here:<br>
