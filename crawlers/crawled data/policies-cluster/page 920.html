Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users, from which any personal information has been removed. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of non-personal information.</p><h2>IN GENERAL</h2><p>We don't collect or record your email address or personal information, unless you send us an email (in which case your email is stored in our email servers) or sign up for the Vector Unit Fan Club (see below).<br />We don't resell any contact information we have to other companies or to marketers. Ever.<br />From time to time a member of the Vector Unit team may contact you directly via an email address you provided. &nbsp;We promise to make such contact infrequent, and meaningful, such as notifying contest winners about their prizes or replying to questions or comments that require a personal response.</p><h2>HERE ON THE WEBSITE</h2><p>When you register for a membership in the Vector Unit Fan Club, we ask you for your full name and email address. &nbsp;We use this information to verify that you are a real person and not a robot.&nbsp;</p><p><br />We do not share your name or email with other companies or business partners. &nbsp;Your information is stored on the servers at Squarespace where we keep all our web data. &nbsp;You can find a copy of Squarespace's privacy policy here.<br />On your member profile page, you can chose whether other members can contact you via email. &nbsp;By default this is checked to \"YES\", but you can change it by un-checking the box. &nbsp;To change your profile preferences, log in and click on the gray box in the upper right hand corner of the browser window.</p><p>We automatically receive and store certain other types of information whenever you interact with the website.

this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. &nbsp;Also from time to time, you may send us personal information voluntarily, for example when you email us for support.</p><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;

white-space: pre-wrap;">Specifically, this may include information like your device type, unique device identification numbers, broad geographic location (e.g. country derived from IP address) and technical information such as crash reporting. &nbsp;In addition, we may collect information about your interactions with our Games, such as how long you play for, or whether you've encountered any technical glitches.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This type of anonymized data enables us to figure out how players use our Games, so we can make improvements to our Games over time, such as fixing bugs or identifying areas of the game which are too difficult.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition, in some of our free to play games we also partner with mobile advertising networks, such as <a href="https://www.adcolony.com/">AdColony</a>. &nbsp;Each of these companies collect some pseudonymized usage data from players, such as whether or not a player finishes watching an ad all the way through, or whether or not a user clicks on an ad. &nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;
