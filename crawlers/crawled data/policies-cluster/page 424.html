      Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to
      the Service ("User Contents") may become available to the public. Once you

      information.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chapter4">4. Retention of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information
      in accordance with the following principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>at least</u> for the duration for which the information is used to
        provide you with our Service;
      </li>
      <li>
        as required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory
        obligations (e.g., tax laws); or
      </li>
      <li>
        only for as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was
        collected, is processed, or longer if required under any contract, by
        applicable law, or, in anonymized form, for statistical purposes,
        subject to appropriate safeguards. For example, if a dispute arises
        between you and Company or you fail to make payment for our Service, we
        may retain relevant information until such dispute is resolved or until
        such payment is made, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we process your information with your consent, we process the data
        until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us
        to implement your requests). We also keep a record of your requests in
        order to respect them in future.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="chapter5">5. Your Choices</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      You can unsubscribe from our marketing communications at any time by
      contacting us directly (see “<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>” section below). As noted in the
      Your Rights section below, you have the right to object to use of personal
      data for direct marketing purposes at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we
      will still send you service messages to provide you with necessary
      information in relation to your contract and the Service you use (for
      example, to update you on changes to our Terms of Use).
    </p>
    <h2 id="chapter6">6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent provided by applicable law, you can request access to your
      personal information, or correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate
      personal information we hold about you. You may also have the right to
      request that we delete personal information that we hold about you. You
      may access and update some of your information through your account
      settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information
      up-to-date.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent provided by applicable laws, you can also ask us to restrict
      or limit the processing of your personal information, as well as to
      provide you with personal information that we have collected from you so
      that you may use it for your own purposes, and to ask us to share (port)
      this data to another controller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, to the extent provided by applicable law, you can object to
      the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular,
      where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other
      legal requirement).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        You also may have the right under applicable law to object at any time
        to the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes,
        including profiling relating to direct marketing.
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, these <b>rights may be limited</b>, for example if fulfilling
      your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they
      would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if
      you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or
      have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of
      relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.
      To make a request concerning your rights or to make an inquiry, use the
      contact details under the “<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>” section below.

    <h2 id="chapter7">7. How We Protect Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We take the protection of your information seriously and we have in place
      safeguards designed to protect the information we collect through our
      Service. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to
      protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer
      system, or wireless connection is completely secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, however, that the Service allows you to share text messages,
      photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the Service with
      other users, and if you choose to share these items with other Service
      users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them
      unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text
      messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the
      Service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you
      should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that
      information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending
      in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared
      the information). The Service is not responsible for any use or misuse of
      information you share.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chapter8">8. Personal Information of Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is not directed to children under the age of fourteen (14) and
      we do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information
      from children under the age of fourteen (14) as part of the Service.
      Additionally, we do not knowingly sell the personal information of
      children under the age of sixteen (16). If we become aware that we have
      inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user
      under the age of fourteen (14) as part of the Service, we will immediately
      delete such information from our records. If you believe that a child
      under the age of fourteen (14) may have provided us with personal
      information, please contact us using the information specified in the “<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>” section below.

    <p>
      If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by

    <h2 id="chapter11">Supplementary Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The following additional terms apply respectively to users having
      residence in or nationality of certain countries. In the event of any
      conflict between the following additional terms and the provisions of the
      main body of this Privacy Policy, the following terms shall prevail.
    </p>
    <h3>
      1. For Users Having Usual Residence in European Economic Area (EEA), UK or
      Switzerland
    </h3>
    <h4>A. International Transfer of Personal Information</h4>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the EEA (that is in the European Union and
      Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway), UK or Switzerland, we will transfer your
      personal information to the Republic of Korea and other countries outside
      the EEA, UK or Switzerland including the United States, Turkey, Malta,
      Thailand, Egypt, India, Hong Kong and Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a company based in South Korea. Though there are no adequacy
      decisions between South Korea and your country of residence, the data
      transfer to Korea is nevertheless justified because all data we collect is
      also necessary to provide the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where we share your data with recipients as described, we will take
      appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable laws, to ensure that
      your personal information remains adequately protected. Such measures
      include for instance the use of EU approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
      In some instances, we will also rely on your explicit consent, where this
      is appropriate. To request more information or obtain a copy of the
      contractual agreements or other safeguards in place, use the contact
