  <h5 class="sans-black">4. Information Communication with Third Parties</h5>
  <p>Etermax may share your Personal Information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Service Providers.</b> We may establish a business relationship with other businesses that we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“<i><b>Service Providers</b></i>”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, and marketing and promotions and to process payments and purchases authorized by you. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.</li>
    <li><b>Third parties and general public.</b> By using the Site or the Services you may be making certain Personal Information available to others. For example, when you create a profile, other users will be able to see your username or nickname, as well as additional information from your profile that you have chosen to make public (such as your name, or username, a short biography, your location, your personal website, your phone number, your picture, your city, country and other information that you choose to make available to others).  When you submit content to us (including questions and answers) you grant us permission to use that content for any and all purposes, including publicly posting and distributing that content through the Services or outside the Services through third parties. When you enter competitions related to the Services, we may publish, share or disclose your Personal Information and other information about you in connection with the competition.</li>
    <li><b>Social networks.</b> As it is the case with other services, if you sign up to our Services using a third party, such as Facebook, your account with us will be connected automatically to your Facebook account and the username and profile picture you use on Facebook will become your username and profile picture in your Etermax account as well. We may share your username, profile picture, country, activity status and information related to your gameplay and use of the Services with said third party, and this information may be published in your timeline and your friends' newsfeed in third parties such as Facebook.<br> In addition, you may allow the Services to interact with third party social networks and/or platforms, such as Facebook, which may provide data about you to Etermax. These social networks and/or platforms, or any similar third-party application or website, are owned by third parties and not by Etermax. You must ensure that you read their terms of service and privacy policies. You understand that when you allow our Services to interact with any third party social network and/or platform, Etermax may share data about you with your contacts and other users of the Services, and vice versa. This information may include your name, profile picture, activity status, and information related to your gameplay and use of the Services. You may be able to change this by adjusting your settings with that third party provider.</li>
    <li><b>Advertising Partners and publicists help us with promotional efforts that allow us to provide these Services for free.</b> As described in “<a href="#publicity-analytics">Section 12 regarding “Third Party Advertising and Analytics – Interest Based Ad Disclosure</a>”, our advertising partners will be able to collect advertising identifiers and other Personal Information in order to provide you with ads based in your interests.</li>
    <li><b>Other Service users.</b> When you chat with other users (please check our Terms of Service for the use and potential precautions when using our chats), send communications, or post messages publicly or privately, those communications, comments and chats are shared with the intended recipients, who may then share the communications with others through the Services or outside the Services. You understand that, once you share communications or your profile with others, even if it is only shared with one or two other users, that information is no longer private and cannot be made private again. Etermax cannot control the actions of other users with whom you communicate or share information.</li>
    <li><b>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement, and Protection of Our Site, Services and Others.</b> Etermax may disclose your Personal Information to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request made by competent agencies. We may access, read, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, your non-personal information, your user content, chat records or records of other communications, any content you post or upload, and any other information about you, to government or law enforcement officials or private parties, if in our sole discretion, we believe it to be necessary or appropriate in order to (i) satisfy any applicable law (including court orders and subpoenas), (ii) investigate potential violations of, or enforce, our Terms of Service (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, (v) protect the safety, property, or rights of our company, our users, or of any third party, or (vi) prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.</li>
    <li><b>Anonymized or Aggregated Information.</b> Etermax may use and share aggregated and/or anonymized information about users with third parties. You cannot be personally identified from such information.</li>
    <li><b>Other communications.</b> We may share information (including Personal Information and other information and data about users) with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with our Company. If our Company is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, it will result in the handling of your Personal Information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You acknowledge that you have no expectation of privacy for or concerning any of the above information, including your chats and communications with other users or with us, content you submit to us (including questions and answers) and content you provide in connection with competitions, information from your profile that you choose to make public, or your use of these features of the Site or Services.</p>
