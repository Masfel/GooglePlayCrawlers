If you choose to use the “Contact Us” form you will be asked to provide Personal Information, request type of inquiry, and describe the purpose for which you are contacting Playdigious.

Some examples of metadata that Playdigious may collect and analyze include, without limitation, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information (such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform), the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click sequence to, through, and from the Playdigious Services, including date and time, cookie number and any products, services or features you use or interact with arising out of or in connection with your use of the Playdigious Services.</p>
<p>Log files. As true of most websites, Playdigious gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.</p>
<p>Tools. Playdigious may use software tools to measure and collect information about your use of the Playdigious Services, including, without limitation, page response times, upload and file transfer errors, interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse- overs), features use, purchase tracking and order fulfillment and methods. Sometimes, you will have a choice whether or not to provide information, but if you fail to provide certain information it could impact some features and/or functionalities of the Playdigious Services.</p>
<p>Information from Other Sources. Playdigious may receive information about you from Playdigious’s third-party service providers, or other sources such as purchase or redemption information, Playdigious Services usage, payment information, reporting information, page-view information, technical, fulfillment, advertising, search information and credit history information.</p>
<p>Mobile Analytics. Playdigious uses mobile analytics software to better understand the functionality of its Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. Playdigious does not link the information stored within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the application.</p>
<p><b>3. How Information Is Used, Shared and Disclosed.</b><br>
Playdigious does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as Playdigious does not share information that may be collected from your child. Playdigious uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the Playdigious Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of Playdigious’s business. Examples of how Playdigious shares and discloses your information is as follows:</p>
<p>Legal. Playdigious may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise Playdigious’s legal rights. Playdigious may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when Playdigious believes that disclosure is necessary to protect Playdigious’s rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. Playdigious may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>Business Transfers. As Playdigious continues to develop its business, Playdigious may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of Playdigious’s assets are acquired or Playdigious merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that Playdigious reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, Playdigious will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control. Playdigious may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on Playdigious’s behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Playdigious will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. Playdigious shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>4. Security.</b><br>
The security of your Personal Information is important to Playdigious. Playdigious follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Playdigious, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, Playdigious cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, Playdigious and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by Playdigious. For Playdigious, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a “need to know” basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by Playdigious is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology, “SSL”) by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.</p>
<p><b>5. Advertising.</b><br>
Playdigious may use ads and ad-relating features in the Playdigious Services. Such ads and ad-relating features may contain cookies that recognize your device each time you receive an online ad. This allows ad servers to compile information about your viewing and interaction with their ad and deliver targeted ads that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, and Playdigious encourages you to review the applicable advertiser’s website for their privacy policy. If Playdigious uses pop-up ad windows irrelevant to the function of any of its games, you will be able to close the pop-up window.<br>
Playdigious has third-party ads in free versions of its mobile applications and, provided that you are age 13 or older, Playdigious collects your Device ID and may pass it to advertisers to enable certain advertising. Playdigious does not store or otherwise save your Device ID.</p>
<p><b>6. Social Media Features and Tools.</b><br>
The Playdigious Services may include integrated social media features and tools, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the YouTube “Share This” button, and interactive mini-programs that run in the Playdigious Services. These Features may collect information on your IP address, which page you are visiting on Playdigious’s site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media features and tools are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on the Playdigious Services. Your interactions with these integrated social media features and tools are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><b>7. Google+ or Other OpenID Provider.</b><br>
You may be able to log in to some of Playdigious’s mobile applications using sign-in services such as Google+ or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with Playdigious such as your name and email address to pre-populate Playdigious’s sign up form. Services like Google+ give you the option to post information about your activities on the Playdigious website to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
<p><b>8. Links to Other Sites.</b><br>
The Playdigious Services contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Playdigious. Please be aware that Playdigious is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Playdigious encourages you to be aware when you leave Playdigious’s site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Playdigious Services.</p>
<p><b>9. Access/Data Retention.</b><br>
If you or your child’s information changes, or if you no longer desire the Playdigious Services, you may make corrections and updates, delete inaccuracies, or request deletion or further contact with you or your child, by updating your account information or by contacting Playdigious at Playdigious@gmail.com . Playdigious will respond to your access request within 15 days.<br>
Playdigious will retain you and your child’s information for as long as you or your child’s account is active, or as needed to provide services. If you wish to cancel your child’s account or request that Playdigious no longer use the information to provide services, contact Playdigious at the email address listed above. Playdigious will retain and use the information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><b>10. Special Notice REGARDING MINORS.</b><br>
Playdigious does not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 13 without parental consent. Playdigious requires device owners to specify their age before any Personal Information is collected. If it comes to Playdigious’s attention that Personal Information has been collected from a person under the age of 13, Playdigious will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you believe that Playdigious may have Personal Information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact Playdigious at Playdigious@gmail.com</p>
<p><b>11. Conditions of Use/Changes to This Privacy Policy.</b><br>
Playdigious may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to information practices. If Playdigious makes any material changes, Playdigious will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on Playdigious’s website, www.Playdigious.com prior to the change becoming effective. Playdigious encourages you to periodically review this page for the latest information on its privacy practices. If Playdigious makes material changes to how Personal Information collected from children under age 13 is used, Playdigious will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable parental consent or, if Playdigious does not have such emails to contact parents directly, by reasonable means on Playdigious’s website for the new uses of the child’s Personal Information.</p>
