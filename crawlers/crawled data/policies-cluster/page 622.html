In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (see “EU Data Subjects Legal Rights”). In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>



<p><strong>9. International Data Transfers</strong></p>



<p>We have our headquarters in the United States. Information we collect from you will be processed in the United States. Where we transfer EU data subject’s personal information to third parties outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on appropriate suitable safeguards or specific derogations recognized under data protections law, including the GDPR.

<p><strong>10. EU Data Subjects Privacy Rights</strong></p>

Data retained for these purposes will be handled as described in Section 9 “Data Retention”, above.</p>



<p><strong>Objection.&nbsp;</strong>You may object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>



<p><strong>Restriction.&nbsp;</strong>You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>

We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

<p>Withdraw Consent. If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>



<p><strong>File a complaint.&nbsp;</strong>You have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority about our collection and processing of your personal information.</p>



<p>To file a request or take action on one of your rights, please contact us at the contact details provided. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
