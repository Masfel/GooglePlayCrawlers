  <h2>
    PURPOSE
  </h2>
  <p>
    The website available at <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com">https://www.wikiloc.com</a>,
    including any of its subdomains or sections
    (the <strong>"Website"</strong>) and any of the mobile applications linked to the Website
    (<strong>"Applications"</strong>) are
    operated by Wikiloc Outdoor, S.L. (<strong>"Wikiloc"</strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy deals with the processing of Website and Applications users’ personal data
    by Wikiloc as part of the services provided through the Website and the Applications
    (<strong>"Services"</strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    By accessing and using the Website or the download or use of the Applications, it is understood
    that the user has read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. The date at the beginning
    of this Privacy Policy refers to the latest update of this Privacy Policy, which will be
    applicable from the date of publication. Thus Wikiloc recommends that this Privacy Policy is
    reviewed on a regular basis by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the Services provided through the Website or of the Applications may be subject to
    specific privacy policies that will complement or, if in conflict with this Privacy Policy,
    supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. The user will accept any specific privacy policies
    that may apply before the provision of such service commences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, access and use of the Website, and download and use of the Applications and
    Services are subject to the Terms of Use.
  </p>

  <h2>
    1. PERSONAL DATA FILES, PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING AND TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Purposes of the processing of personal data
  </h3>
  <p>
    Wikiloc process personal data collected through the Services for the purpose of managing the
    Website and the Applications and also for providing or improving the provision of Services,
    including sending email and relevant notifications about the Service, the trails requested by
    the user, the content accessed by the User or with information or recommendations regarding the
    Service, the Website or Applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a user wishes to stop receiving recommendations or notifications, the user may deactivate it
    on the user’s preferences page. Likewise, the “push” notifications can be deactivated directly
    on the configuration system of the user’s device for specific applications.
  </p>
  <h3>Categories of personal data processed</h3>
  <p>
    Personal data that can be collected at the time of registration of the user or afterwards, are
    the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nickname (mandatory).</li>
    <li>Password (mandatory).</li>
    <li>Email address (mandatory).</li>
    <li>Home page or weblog.</li>
    <li>About user (description).</li>
    <li>Photo.</li>
    <li>Activities of interest.</li>
    <li>User’s location.</li>
    <li>Units of measure.</li>
    <li>Unique ID of the device.</li>
    <li>Privacy settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Wikiloc does not collect the age or the date of birth of its users. Accordingly, there is no
    specific processing of minor’s personal data. Wikiloc is only addressed to users above 16 years
    old. If the user is under age he should not register on Wikiloc.</p>
  <p>Additionally, users may upload their trails through the Services or record them on the
    Application (in which case information and data related to the route are immediately collected),
    in both cases including geographical information, date, means of transport, trail duration,
    difficulty level, pictures taken, videos recorded and any comments they deem appropriate. Users
    may also identify their favorite trails, and keep track of other users’ activities.
  </p>
  <p>When using the Services, information is also generated about that use of the platform such as
    searches, follow-ups, interactions, posts or downloads, which will be used by Wikiloc to provide
    and improve the Services.
  </p>
  <p>If the user wishes to use the Services which include location features, such as the recording
    of a trail or of a point of interest or the navigation through a downloaded trail, the Services
    may imply the processing of the location of the user, which will be used for the purposes
    established hereunder and to allow or improve the Service.
  </p>
  <h3>Processing within Garmin Connect IQ</h3>
  <p>Likewise, when the user uses the Application for Garmin Connect IQ, the Application will
    collect and retain the anonymous identifier of the Garmin device and associate it with the
    account of the user in the Services, in order to maintain the session and avoid the introduction
    of user and password in the uninstalls or updates of the Application. The user may at any time
    unlink and eliminate such association through the profile settings.
  </p>
  <h3>Processing through the Contact form</h3>
  <p>Any information received from Wikiloc in the Contact form available in the Website will only be
    used with the purpose of solving queries, suggestions or claims sent from the users in the
    Website. Also, personal data included on the comments in the blog of wikiloc.com will only be
    used for the purpose of answering those comments when necessary.
  </p>
  <h3>Processing of HealthKit data</h3>
  <p>The Application for Apple Watch may request the user for permission to use HealthKit data.
    Wikiloc does not store or share the user’s HealthKit data, nor it uses the data for any medical
    purpose. If the user grants the permission to use HealthKit data in the Application, the reading
    of the user’s heart rate shall be displayed within the Application so that the user is able to
    monitor such reading and, when the user is performing a compatible activity (like hiking,
    running or cycling), the user’s workout data will be synced to the user’s Apple Workouts. Such
    data shall not be processed by Wikiloc outside the local installation of the Application in the
    Apple Watch.
  </p>
  <p>Wikiloc shall not use the user’s HealthKit data for any other purpose, including advertising,
    marketing or other use-based data mining purposes and will never disclose the data to third
    parties.
  </p>
  <p>You can find more about Apple’s HealthKit Privacy policy at Apple Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3>Legal basis for processing personal data</h3>
  <p>The legal basis for processing the user’s personal data is the contractual relationship for the
    rendering of Services or when appropriate, the fulfillment of the user’s request, as well as the
    legitimate interest of Wikiloc in offering the Services in the different channels where the
    trails may be published and in informing about news on the Service offered to users registered
    that have not rejected the receipt of this information.
  </p>
  <h3>Period for the processing of personal data</h3>
  <p>Personal data will be stored during the period required for the compliance with the purpose for
    which the data was collected and, afterwards, during the periods required by applicable
    regulations. When a user’s application for registration is not validated within 7 days, the
    user’s data will be erased.
  </p>


  <h2 id="cookies">2. USE OF COOKIES</h2>
  <p>The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website, with
    technical, analytical purposes as well as to show personalized advertisement.
  </p>
  <p>A cookie is a small piece of text that web sites you visit send to the browser to allow the web
    site to remember information about your visit. The cookies are downloaded to device from the
    Website and they are used to register certain interactions with the browser, storing data that

    number of visitors on pages or allow you to log in to download content and access your personal
    space.
  </p>
  <p>Wikiloc cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website and help Wikiloc analyze
    the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user’s
    browser that prevents the user from having to remember and then enter a password more than once
    during a visit to the Website. On most web browsers, users will find a "help" section on the
    toolbar. Wikiloc refers to this section for information on how to receive notification when
    receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Wikiloc informs users that allowing the use
    of cookies by their browser will permit users to take advantage of some of the Website's
    features.
  </p>

    the user relies on to access the service or even the location from which the service is
    accessed, etc. </p>
  <p><u>Behavioral advertising cookies:</u> These are the cookies which allow for the handling, in
    the most efficient way possible, the advertising spots on the Website or those which allow for
    the storage of the users’ behavior information received through the continuous observation of
    their browsing habits, which in turn allows for developing a specific profile to show
    advertising in accordance with the same. </p>

    cookies can be <strong>Absolutely Necessary</strong>, that are those cookies which allow for the
    communication between the user’s personal device and the Internet or that render services
    resulting from the explicit request of the user. In those cases, the user’s consent is not
