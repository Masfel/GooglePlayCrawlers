            <p>

                ASR does not collect or transfer any data to us or to any third party unless stated below.
            </p>

            <h4>Microphone access</h4>
            <p>
                ASR uses your phone's microphone  to record. This is the only way to do so.
                ASR does not collect or transfer any audio or voice data to us or to any third party. If you use cloud services it will have to transfer audio of the recording to the cloud service while uploading recordings.

            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>



            <h4>Auto Email (AE)</h4>
            <p>
                AE is an optional premium future of ASR. It requires you to save your email address and login details in ASR settings, which, is only accessible to ASR and is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ASR uses stored login information to auto login to your email provider's system and sends your last recording (like an email app) from your email service to the email address you specify in AE settings or communicate with your email provider's mail service.
                If you are not comfortable with above, you can always use Auto Email (Gmail) and setup auto email without giving out your details

            </p>

                If you are not comfortable with above, you can always use Auto Email (Gmail) and setup auto email without giving out your details

            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>

            <h4> WebDAV</h4>
            <p>
                WebDAV is a standard HTTP protocol to transfer files from clients to servers. WebDAV is an optional premium future of ASR. It requires you to save your login details for your webserver or WebDAV service in ASR settings, which is only accessible to ASR and it is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ASR uses stored login information to auto login to your WebDAV service and upload your recordings.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <h4> FTP</h4>
            <p>
                FTP is a file transfer protocol to transfer files from clients to servers. FTP is an optional premium future of ASR. It requires you to save your login details for your FTP service in ASR settings that, is only accessible to ASR and it is not stored or transferred outside your phone. ASR uses stored login information to auto login to your FTP server and upload your recordings.

            </p>

                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <h4>
                Other cloud services
            </h4>
            <p>
                ASR supports other cloud services such as Dropbox and Google drive.  These services are being accessed if and when user links their account with ASR. Due to nature of linking and access, ASR can only access certain areas of the cloud service and these are clearly explained to user during authorisation request by the cloud service.

                ASR uses given authorisation to upload and store your recordings on the cloud service and can delete or re-upload recordings on your request within ASR cloud services setting.

            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <!-- <h4>
        Advertising
    </h4>
    <p>
        ASR uses Google's mobile advertising platform Admob in free version and fully complies with their privacy and the developer's policy.
        Admob uses Google's Advertising ID API (which ASR has no access) to provide adverts to you. These adverts can include targeted ones. You can access settings related to advertising under Google settings app on your phone. Those settings enabled and controlled by Google. You can read it <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/</a>
        <br /><br />
        No advertising displayed if you upgrade ASR to Pro.

                Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
            </h4>
            <p>
                FCM is part of the core of the Android and used by Google and developers to communicate with your phone via Google services.

In order to do that we store a very long random string of text that is unique to ASR.  This information does not contain any personal information whatsoever and cannot be used anywhere apart from ASR. It is deleted as soon as you are opt-out from receiving updates under ASR settings.
                You can read more about FCM at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/">https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/</a>
