<h1><strong>Miniwan Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Last updated on November 21st, 2019</strong><br>
<strong>1. About Mini World Block Art and this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mini World Block Art is a sandbox game, where users are encouraged to play, create, and interact with whatever they can imagine. As a user of Mini World Block Art, you and your friends can play games, collaborate on building or just gather and explore other users’ creations. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it, and who we share it with.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy covers our websites on the en.mini1.cn domain, our Mini World Block Art game and other services (“Service”), on which an authorized link to this privacy policy is posted. This Policy covers our practices with regard to users of all ages, including those users under the age of 13 (“children”). The Service is operated by or on behalf of Miniwan Technology Co., Limited (“Miniwan”).</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are an EU resident, this whole Policy applies to you. Miniwan is also committed to protecting the privacy of our users, including children. Please see the “Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls” section below for more information about your rights as a parent or legal guardian of our children users and the measures we take to afford children users with additional protections and comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is important for you to understand how the collection and use of your personal information happens and how you may control your personal information. When you contract to use the Service, you accept our rules and policies regarding your personal information and you expressly consent to us collecting, processing, using and storing your personal information, as described in this policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You acknowledge that you have read and understood this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, you must not use the Services and play the Mini World Block Art game. If you continue to use the Service and play the Mini World Block Art, you are deemed to agree with privacy policy. If you change your mind in the future, you may withdraw your consent to use of your personal information in accordance with this policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy and/or data practices, please contact us at the following e-mail address, telephone number, or mailing address:</strong></p>
<p><strong>miniwantech@gmail.com</strong><br>
<strong>Miniwan Technology Co., Limited</strong><br>
<strong>Address: ROOM1303 BUILDING B, LIYUAN SQUARE, ROAD DONGBIN, DISTRICT NANSHAN, GUANGDONG SHENZHEN, CHINA</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Personal Data” means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Processing” means any operation which is performed on personal data, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or any kind of disclosure or other use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any other capitalized term that is not defined in this Policy is defined (and has the meaning) set out in our Term of Use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Information Collected on our Website</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that our Websites (en.mini1.cn and their subdomains) are general audience websites. On these sites, we may provide information regarding the game update information, press information, and other general audience information. We may also ask for your name, email address, if you send us a message or other information so that we can provide information to your request. No game play happens on the Websites. As such, the parts of this Privacy Policy that discuss game play or discuss children users under 13 are not applicable to the Website.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. How Mini World Block Art Works</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is how Mini World Block Art works:</strong><br>
<strong>An user ID is created automatically for a new user. A virtual character is generated to represent his or her identity in the Mini World Block Art.</strong><br>
<strong>Users interact with other users through in-game, personal messaging, and other similar features. Users can remove friends or delete account to restrict or disable communications with other users.</strong><br>
<strong>Each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real space on which they can unlock items and characters, ripe golden fruit, trade in the game and accelerate the growth of their gardens.</strong><br>
<strong>Users search for, find, and play games made by other users. They play these games with other users around the world, and are identified only by their user ID.</strong><br>
<strong>The Mini World Block Art includes virtual currency known as Mini Coins and Mini Beans, 1 Mini Coins=60 Mini Beans; users can purchase Mini coins and Mini Beans in a variety of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses.</strong><br>
<strong>For more information on how our service works, please see our Terms of Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Setting Up an Account on Mini World Block Art</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users are given an UID when they first enter the game. Then he or she can name the character. Users may be asked to provide some demographic information such as your age or date of birth, gender, country or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Mini World Block Art).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users should not create an username that reflects their own name or other personal data. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share their password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UIDs are used for participating in Service features and we do not use them to identify individual users outside our Service. UIDs are not shared with third-party companies except for the third-party companies who use or process the UIDs for purposes of helping operate our Service, such as effectuating payments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address or bind to the Facebook account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this is to provide account security, as this is the only way for Miniwan to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, users under the age of 13 are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Additional Features and Data Collection on Mini World Block Art</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition to account setup on Mini World Block Art, we may collect and process information from you in connection with the following features and activities (as applicable):</strong><br>
<strong>When you make purchases on the Service. Users can purchase virtual currency or premium subscriptions, for example, in the form of Mini Coins, etc., and use a variety of payment methods. When making purchases, users or their parents may be required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. Miniwan may also retain your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries. Miniwan does not retain the full credit card numbers of our users.</strong><br>
<strong>When you post or otherwise transmit comments or messages on Mini World Block Art via community features such as public chat or private chat, reviews, profile pictures, personal posts, etc. we may collect these comments and messages, pictures and they may be monitored, filtered and moderated for purposes such as removal of profanity, personal data, and other inappropriate conversations.
