    <h2 class="sub-t">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the Clash Arts HK Limited (“Tumile”and its various &amp; next versions, “us”, “we”, or “our”) and is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Use which can be found at its website. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the “Service.” Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Information we collect</h2>
    <p>When you install the Service on your device and register with Tumile, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us. For registration through Tumile, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with Tumile, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your Tumile contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service. If you do not want Tumile to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the Tumile application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information.
    </p>
    <p>Tumile may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, Tumile may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches made by members, match durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.
    </p>
    <p>Tumile allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the Tumile application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other Tumile users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the Tumile application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Tumile is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.
    </p>
    <p>Tumile may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the Tumile, and If they use capturing function provided by the Tumile, those photos can be stored and used for Tumile and 3rd party’s service(eg, Facebook, etc.). You can change sharing option of 3rd party on the Tumile settings. If you do not agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>To complete a commerce transaction on Tumile item shop, you will be requested to provide your payment information, including your credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. In that event, we will transmit your information securely directly to a third party vendor or merchant who will collect such information in order to process and fulfill your purchase. Tumile does not process or store your payment information. However, we may store other information about your purchases made on the Service, which may include the merchant’s name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other behavioral information.
    </p>
    <p>We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Sharing of your information</h2>
    <p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.

    <p> • For internal operations, including troubleshooting problems, data analysis, testing, research, improvements to the Service, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other illegal activity;</p>

    The information you enter into your user profile (your “Profile”) may be shared with your Tumile contacts. You control your Profile and you can access and modify your Profile from the Tumile application at any time. In addition, if you register with Tumile using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to other users of the Service who are connected to you on Tumile. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the Tumile application), your Profile is discoverable by other Tumile users, including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users. You may also “block out” any Tumile user in your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time. In addition, Tumile may pre-populate your Profile with certain information such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you or your friends have logged onto the Service using Facebook.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Data Access and Removal</h2><p>
    You can always control what information you choose to share with us on the Service. To do so, you can change your settings in the Service or in your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Service from your mobile device entirely.

Tumile is not responsible for any use or misuse of your information that might result from your disclosure of information.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Service Providers</h2><p>
    In certain instances, Tumile may have contracts with third parties to provide products and/or services in connection with the Service. In those cases, Tumile may share your personal information with Tumile’s third-party service providers, but only in connection with providing the services to you. For example, Tumile shares your phone number or email with third party SMS and email providers to deliver the authentication SMS or email to you when you register with Tumile. We contractually require that these third parties use your information solely to deliver SMS or email to you and to use appropriate security measures to protect your information. In addition, certain Tumile servers are owned and hosted by third party service providers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third party service providers.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Outbound Links</h2><p>
    If you accessed a website, product or service provided by a third party, including through the Service or a Tumile website, such third party may also collect information about you. Please see the privacy policies of each such third party for more information about how they use the information they collect. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any exchange of information between you and any third party.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-t">Security</h2><p>
    Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for Tumile. We make substantial efforts to ensure the privacy of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access to all personally identifiable information is restricted to those Tumile employees, contractors, agents and third-party service providers who need to know that information in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support or improve the Service. Tumile uses password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all member information.

    The Service is not directed to children under the age of eighteen (18) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of eightteen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of eighteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records.
