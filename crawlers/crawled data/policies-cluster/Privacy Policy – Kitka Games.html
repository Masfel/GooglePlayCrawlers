Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.</p>



<h1>YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS</h1>



<h2>Opt-out of marketing e-mails and other direct marketing</h2>



<p>You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications, such as marketing e-mails from us by following the instructions in such communications.</p>



<h2>Opt-out of targeted advertising</h2>



<p>You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your iOS or Android device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You can also visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Page, which provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.&nbsp; Additionally, some third parties that serve Interest-based ads via mobile apps may offer you choices regarding such practices and their technologies, including offering a device-based opt-out option via a downloadable app available at: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. We are not responsible for this app, including without limitation its accuracy or limitations, or any representations made in connection with it.</p>



<p>For personalized in-game advertising you will be asked for consent before watching the first ad. If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time using the options provided in the game settings. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>



<h2>Access the personal data we hold about you</h2>



<p>If you request, we will provide you a copy of your personal data in an electronic format.</p>



<h2>Your other rights</h2>



<p>You also have the right to correct your data, have your data deleted, object to how we use or share your data, and restrict how we use or share your data. You can always withdraw your consent, for example by turning off GPS location sharing in your mobile device settings.</p>



<p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.&nbsp; For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. We will respond to all requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we may also take additional steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request, such as by requesting you provide us a purchase receipt or other account information, asking you to link your email address with your game account or asking you to answer questions regarding your activities on our Services. Once you have verified your identity, you may also designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights on your behalf by providing the agent’s contact information to our customer support staff, as required by applicable law.</p>



<p>You may have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment as a result of your exercise of these rights.</p>



<h1>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h1>



<p>To provide our Games and interest-based advertising, we use advertising identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. This section describes our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.</p>



<p>Advertising identifiers, cookies and similar technologies are used by us to provide our Services to you and in order to collect data from your device. These technologies allow us and our third-party advertising partners to (i) recognise you and your device; (ii) provide interest-based advertising to you; (iii) allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction); (iv) allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and (v) enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our Services in the correct language (subject to availability).</p>



<p>Advertising identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple’s ID for advertising (IDFA), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include cookies on Websites and tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognise your device when you use websites and applications.</p>



<p>If you wish to prevent your device’s advertising identifier being used for interest-based advertising, please check the privacy settings of your mobile device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). You can also choose to reset your device’s ad identifier from the device settings. In a similar way, you can also disable cookies from your browser’s settings if you do not want to be tracked by websites. This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third-party advertisers. Please see more information about these partners under the “With whom do we share your personal information” heading above. You may also see our own advertisements in other games and services. If you click such advertisements and install our Game(s), we may share a device identifier with our partners to verify installs.</p>



<h1>How do we keep your personal information secure?</h1>



<p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use include that only those of our employees, who on behalf of their work are entitled to process personal information, are entitled to use a system containing personal information. Each user has a personal username and password to the system. The information is collected into databases that are protected by firewalls, passwords and other technical measures. The databases and the backup copies are in locked premises and can be accessed only by certain pre-designated persons. We also aim to minimize the personal information that we process, for example, our Games do not require you to register an account with your name and other details. Moreover, we use only advertiser identifiers and other more technical information to recognize players.</p>



<h2>International data transfers</h2>



<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>



<p>Specifically, our servers are located in Germany and Finland, and our third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries.</p>



<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or other similar arrangements (such as the Privacy Shield certification regarding transfers to United States) for transfers of personal information between us and our third-party service providers and partners located outside the European Union or European Economic Area.</p>



<h1>Data retention</h1>



<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>



<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>



<h1>AGE LIMITS</h1>



<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.&nbsp; If you are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address.&nbsp; No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data.&nbsp; If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible.&nbsp; If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>



<h1>How to contact us?</h1>



<p>The data controller is Kitka Games Oy, domicile Kajaani, Finland, business ID 3116739-9.</p>



<p>Should you have any questions regarding this Privacy policy or the processing of your personal information, please contact us at support@kitkagames.com</p>



<p>To restrict the use of your personal data, to remove, correct or access it, please contact us via email support@kitkagames.com</p>
