IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level).</li></ul>



<p><strong>4.3. View of Our ads on third-party services</strong></p>



<p>We also advertise Games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve them to audiences that will be interested in them (determined using Advertising IDs).</p>



<p>The Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed âThird Partiesâ) including:</p>



<ul><li>measuring ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs they generate through their advertising in other publishersâ games);</li><li>informing players, that have not been playing for a while, about new content in the Game. We give a list of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then shows these users ads about the new content.</li><li>not showing ads on a game which a player is already playing. We can send a list of active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then excludes these players from seeing the ad.</li><li>marketing games to a group of potential players.</li></ul>



<p><strong>4.4. WHO CAN SHOW PERSONALIZED ADS TO YOU?</strong></p>



<p>Please see the following list of advertising providers that are allowed to show personalized advertising and review their data processing practices, including the technologies they use for the purposes of personalized advertising.</p>

<p><strong>4.5. HOW CAN YOU TURN OFF PERSONOLIZED ADS?</strong></p>



<p>Besides specific instruments available to EEA-based users via the Game you can use your device&nbsp; settings.</p>



<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>



<p>Open the âSettingsâ application of iOS and select the âPrivacyâ menu item and then the âAdvertisingâ sub-item. If you activate the âLimit ad trackingâ option, we can only take limited measures such as identifying unique users or combating fraud. In the same menu you can always delete the IDFA (âReset Ad-IDâ), then a new ID is created which is not merged with the data collected earlier.</p>



<p><strong>Android</strong></p>



<p>Open the âSettingsâ application and select the âGoogleâ menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not be visible on the main menu but you may use the search function at the top of the Settings menu to find it. From there, select the âAdsâ sub-item and activate the option âOpt out of Ads Personalisationâ to prevent the creation of profiles and the display of personalized advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (âReset advertising IDâ), then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.</p>



<ol><li><strong>THIRD-PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKS</strong></li></ol>

<p><strong>5.2. Information We May Receive When You Connect to Third-Party Social Networks</strong></p>



<p>The information you allow us to access varies by App and is affected by the privacy settings you establish on those Third-Party Social Networks.

Other information will be merely stored within the App on your device so that the App will be able to communicate with Third Party Social Network directly.</p>
