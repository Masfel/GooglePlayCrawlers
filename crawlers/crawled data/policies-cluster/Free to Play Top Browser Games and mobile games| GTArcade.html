<br>
<span style="color:#666666;"> We have implemented data security management system that meets industry-standard, including organizational processes and technical solutions, to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, modification, copy, or deletion.

We have encryption mechanism and strict access control to protect data in database. Besides, we have implemented collaborative security defense system at both network and terminal level to protect the information system and the computing environment. In addition to the technical solutions, we also implemented information security management system, which is based on ISO27001, to set up policy, process and procedures which regulate employees’ daily information processing activities, such as access, modify, editing, storage, share, transfer and deletion. This system ensures that only authorized personnel can access the protected data, and can be used only in the authorized way. And we also provide training and arrange awareness raising activities about data security and privacy protection, so as to enhance employees' awareness regarding the importance of personal data protection.</span><br>
