        <p>Our websites may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers and operating system-based identifiers. Ironhide treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.</p>
        <p>Cookies: A "cookie" is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are "1st Party," from the website itself, and others are "3rd party," belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks. Ironhide’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to "remember" your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use our services.</p>
        <p>Web Beacons and pixel tags: A "web beacon" or a "pixel tag" is an electronic image (often not visible to the end-user) that allows Ironhide to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Additionally, e-mails and other electronic communications Ironhide sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Ironhide to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed, if any.</p>
