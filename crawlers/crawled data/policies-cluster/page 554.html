<p>e) Cryptography: name given to the information coding process. Information are codified (shuffled) at origin and decoded at destination, thereby making any attempt to decipher such information harder in the online traffic.</p>

<h3>2 &nbsp; Purpose of the Request for Personal Information and Biological Information by the SITE and APP</h3>

<p>2.1 &nbsp; One of the BTFIT’s guidelines is respect for individuals. We therefore have the commitment to maintain your personal and access information confidential, which information shall only be bound to the USER’s registration, to be used for the following purposes:</p>

<p>a) To achieve the provision of the SERVICES, access to the SITE or to the APP;
b) To perform legal obligations of any nature;
c) To obtain general statistics to identify the profile of our USERS and to develop our campaigns;
d) To maintain USER relationship data and actions, as well as the ongoing improvement of the service provided by the SITE and APP.
e) To settle any legal issues relative to the SITE and APP.
f) To promote the SITE and APP to the USER’s contacts.
g) To process Biological Information in order to feed BTFIT with relevant information or to generate technical-scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>2.1.1 &nbsp; Still with respect to the Biological Information, USER represents to accept and agree that such information may be assigned without the USER’s identification to third parties for processing purposes, solely in order to generate technical-scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>2.2 &nbsp; Any information requested from the USERS is necessary to improve and personalize the access and purchase experience in the SITE and APP. Such information shall not be used beyond the events provided for herein, and any use shall always be bound to the rules determined by BTFIT in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>2.3 &nbsp; User warrants the accuracy and truth of the data and information provided to the Site and App, thereby assuming the corresponding liability for any inaccuracy thereof, and also agrees to maintain such data and information duly updated. BTFIT DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF LOSSES CAUSED BY THE INACCURACY OF ANY DATA PROVIDED.</p>

<p>2.4 &nbsp; Any USER who registers in the SITE or APP using third-party information may incur in the crimes of misrepresentation on a public or private document, swindling or other more serious crimes, and may be civilly or criminally liable for such conduct, pursuant to the law.</p>

<h3>3 &nbsp; Obtainment of Personal Information and Access Information</h3>

<p>3.1 &nbsp; Personal Information, capable of identifying the USERS, is collected whenever USERS:</p>

<p>a) interact with the different tools available in the SITE and APP, thus voluntarily submitting such information;

<p>3.3 &nbsp; USER accepts and agrees that BTFIT may confirm the accuracy of the personal information USER has informed at its sole discretion, by consulting government authorities, specialized companies and credit reporting databases.</p>

<p>3.3.1 &nbsp; Such attitude, however, neither ceases nor decreases USER’s liability regarding the accuracy of the data supplied, for which reason BTFIT may suspend and/or cancel USER’s profile, at its sole discretion and at any time, if BTFIT verifies any inaccuracy.</p>

<p>3.4 &nbsp; BTFIT may maintain the USER’s personal information and Access Information for the purposes set forth herein, for up to five (5) years from the termination of the relationship between USER and BTFIT. </p>

<h3>4 &nbsp; Obtainment of the Access Information</h3>

<p>4.1 &nbsp; BTFIT also receives and automatically stores USER Access Information in its servers by using Cookies.</p>

<p>4.2 &nbsp; Cookies enable the computers accessing the SITE and APP to be recognized, and follow the USER’s navigation within the SITE and APP, in order to personalize it according to each USER’s profile. Cookies do not store any Personal Information, but contain only access information. Nevertheless, USER is free to exclude the Cookie from his/her computer at will, or, furthermore, to set up one’s internet browser to automatically reject or exclude cookies. BTFIT nonetheless reinforces that such last option may limit certain SITE or APP functionalities.</p>

<p>4.3 &nbsp; Other technologies may be used to obtain USER navigation data. However, such technologies shall always comply with the terms hereof and the collection and storage options.</p>

<h3>5 &nbsp; Use of the Collected Information</h3>

<p>5.1 &nbsp; Without limiting the other information described herein, USER represents to accept and agree that BTFIT may use the collected information for the following general purposes:</p>

<p>(a) to supply, maintain, protect, develop and improve the SERVICES, including the SITE, APP and the security thereof;

(e) to improve usability and interactive experience during USER’s navigation in the SITE, APP or by means of the SERVICES;
(f) to prepare general statistics;
(g) to ensure the USERS’ safety and to answer to any doubts or requests;
(h) to store USERS’ preferences;
(i) to answer any USERS’ doubts and request;
(j) to regularly appoint, defend, protect or exercise any rights, whether judicially or administratively; and
(k) to conduct research and communications and relationship marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>5.2 &nbsp; BTFIT may also share the Personal Information and Access Information with third parties to comply with the law, any regulations, court orders, government requests or to detect, prevent or address, in any way, any technical matters, fraud or security-related issues, to protect the rights, property and safety of BTFIT, the SITE, APP, SERVICES, its USERS, THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS or any third parties.</p>

<p>5.2.1 &nbsp; To this end, BTFIT informs it must legally disclose the profile information providing personal qualification, filiation and address, if informed, to the legally accredited government authorities, such as Chiefs of Civil Police and the Prosecution Office, pursuant to the terms of Article 10, Paragraph Three of Law 12,965/14. </p>

<h3>6 &nbsp; Protection and Privacy of the Collected Information</h3>

<p>6.1 &nbsp; BTFIT shall take all the necessary measures to maintain the privacy of the personal information and the access information stored in its servers, and agrees to use sufficiently adequate technology to protect such data, and to see to the maintenance of a safe environment, including the use of the appropriate tools and efficient controls for the safety of the collected information, always observing the available technical conditions. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING NO SECURITY SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY SAFE, BTFIT EXEMPTS ITSELF FROM ANY LIABILITIES FOR ANY LOSSES AND/OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF INVASIONS IN THE SITE, APP, ITS SERVERS AND OTHER RELATED FAILURES, EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF BTFIT’S FAULT OR INTENT.</p>

<p>6.2 &nbsp; BTFIT’s professionals are aware of this Privacy Policy and only the qualified and authorized personnel have permission to access the information BTFIT collects, under penalty of suffering disciplinary sanctions in the event of violation of the rules provided for herein.</p>

<p>6.3 &nbsp; BTFIT requires its partner companies and service providers to ensure the protection and privacy of the data ensured under this policy, whenever it is necessary to share such information.</p>

<p>6.4 &nbsp; User acknowledges and accepts that the SITE and APP may make links available to other sites, which, in turn, may collect USER’s information, which may be personally identifiable or not. USER acknowledges and accepts that BTFIT is not liable for the privacy practices of other sites, apps or even of the Online Stores, even if accessed via the SITE or APP, and encourages USER to carefully read the statements of privacy of any and all sites or apps collecting information. This Privacy Policy is exclusively applicable to the information BTFIT collects and processes.</p>

<h3>7 &nbsp; Apple iOS Health App Data (“Health App”)</h3>

<p>In addition to the policies described herein, USER may choose to share his/her information generated or made available by BTFIT with the Apple iOS Health App (“Health App”). USER may decide which information shall be shared and USER may change which apps may access such information via the Health App. This Privacy Policy also applies to the treatment of information the USER’s Health App shares with BTFIT by means of the Apple HealthKit API. Without limiting the other provisions set forth herein:</p>

<p>a) BTFIT does not store the USER’s Health App information in the iCloud;
b) BTFIT does not use the USER’s Health App information in advertising or for any use other than those provided for herein;
c) BTFIT does not share the USER’s Health App information with third parties without the USER’s prior consent;</p>

<h3>8 &nbsp; Security Procedures</h3>

<p>8.1 &nbsp; BTFIT implements the most modern security measures to protect the USER’s Personal Information and Access Information, restricting access exclusively to duly authorized persons.</p>

<p>8.2 &nbsp; Every time the USER accesses the SITE or APP, a new encryption key is created between the USER’s phone or computer and the SITE or APP, in order to make it more difficult for other people to intercept the communication by means of any software. As such, whenever such data is sent, the information is transformed into symbols by means of cryptography, and are only decoded by an authorized and certified server.</p>

<p>8.3 &nbsp; BTFIT also uses a firewall that prevents access to its servers by unauthorized persons. </p>

<p>8.4 &nbsp; Because of the use of said security system, there may be problems in the processing of information if USER is using any outdated version of the internet browser or of the APP itself.</p>

<h3>9 &nbsp; Delivery of Releases and Advertising</h3>

<p>9.1 &nbsp; At its sole discretion, BTFIT may sent releases and advertising messages to its USERS registered in the SITE or APP, or to USERS in general, on a daily basis, using all types of technologies and means of communication available, such as by e-mail, SMS, MMS, direct mail, push notifications, social media and others.</p>

<p>9.2 &nbsp; The releases, newsletters, notices of offers and advertising content sent by e-mail must necessarily include the option to cancel BTFIT’s delivery of that type of message. The cancelation may also be requested via the BTFIT call center, by e-mail info@btfit.com.br. </p>

<p>9.2.1 &nbsp; BTFIT shall make all efforts to complete the request in the shortest time possible. However, considering the procedure involves updating the databases of both BTFIT and the engaged companies, USER understands that the request may take a few days to be fulfilled. </p>

<p>9.3 &nbsp; The delivery cancelation process is bound to the USER’s e-mail. As such, USERS who have more than one registered e-mail may continue receiving the releases or advertising content in the e-mail that has not been unsubscribed.</p>

<p>9.4 &nbsp; The delivery of releases via the channels specified in item 9.1 may be provided by BTFIT or by an outsourced company, which shall use its own services for such delivery.</p>

<p>9.5 &nbsp; The engaged company neither stores nor uses the e-mails registered in the SITE or APP in any way, for any purpose other than the delivery of the messages, according to each USER’s preferences and the provisions set forth herein and in the Terms of Use.</p>

<h3>10 &nbsp; Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>10.1 &nbsp; This Privacy Policy is subject to constant improvements to ensure greater transparency and safety for the USERS. As such, BTFIT reserves itself the right to unilaterally amend this document at any time. The new Privacy Policy shall become effective within ten (10) days from publication thereof in the SITE or APP. </p>

<p>10.2 &nbsp; If USER continues to access the SITE or APP after the amendments become effective, USER automatically agrees to the content of the changes made. USER therefore understands that it is his/her liability to regularly verify whether any changes have been made hereto.</p>

<h3>11 &nbsp; Doubts</h3>

<p>11.1 &nbsp; In the event of doubt in relation to this document or to BTFIT, please contact the BTFIT call center via e-mail: info@btfit.com.br.</p>
