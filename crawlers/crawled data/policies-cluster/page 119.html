      Tech Co., Ltd (the “Company”, “we” or “us”).</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the
      relationship and serve as an agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may
      access and use the Platform and our related websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively,
      the “Services”). Your access to certain Services or features of the Services may be subject to age
      restrictions and not available to all users of the Services. For purposes of these Terms, “you” and
      “your” mean you as the user of the Services. </span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2">Unless you accept the Terms, you have no right or authorization to use
      any part of the Services which requires you to be a Registered User. By accessing or using our Services, you
      confirm that you can form a binding contract with us, that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply
      with them. You understand and agree that we will treat your access or use of the Services as acceptance of the
      Terms from that point onwards. Your access to and use of our Services are also subject to our Privacy Policy,
      which is incorporated herein by reference. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By accessing the Services, you agree
        and represent to us: </span></span></p>

      age of majority in your
      state of nationality and residence, whichever is higher;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2" style="font-weight: bold;">ii) that you are not restricted from using the Services, by
      law, by contract, or by
      us;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2" style="font-weight: bold;">iii) that you fully agree with the terms and conditions set
      forth in the Terms;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2" style="font-weight: bold;">iv) where necessary, your legal guardian has reviewed and
      consented to these Terms and
      agreed to be responsible for any of your liability arising hereof.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Your fundamental rights as a Registered User to the Services are mainly set forth in
      the Terms, so please read all of the terms and conditions carefully. The Terms include a clause of dispute
      resolution by arbitration on an individual basis. The venue of such arbitration may not be in the country where
      you reside.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Please note that our services are not made available in, or to residents of, the

  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">II. Changes to the Terms</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Due to fast developing technologies and law and policies, as well as volatile market
      conditions, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise the Terms from time to
      time at any time, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to be bound by such modifications or
      revisions. Any such modified or revised version will be effective at the time we first post it onto our Platform
      (or at any other time designated in the terms of such version, if any). We will use commercially reasonable
      efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our
      Platform. However, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also put the
      “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms, which reflects the effective date of such Terms. Your
      continued use of the Services thereafter will constitute your acceptance of, and consent to, such modifications or
      revisions. If you object to any such modification or revision, your sole recourse shall be ceasing to use all of
      the Services.</span></p>

      such information changes, you agree to forthwith update such information to us. You become a registered user
      (“Registered User”) of our Services once you log in with your third-party account or phone number and
      cease to be a Registered User when you no longer maintain an Account with us.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">C. You may choose a combination of certain characters (letters, digits and other

      combinations for legal compliance purposes or prevention of personal attack, humiliation, intellectual property
      rights infringement or other improper use of the Account.</span></p>
  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c5 c15">D. You are primarily responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login

      notify us immediately if you believe the confidentiality of your login credentials has been compromised or if you

      from unauthorized use of your login credentials.</span></p>

      void. You are liable for any and all activities done using your Account, even if such activities are not actually
      conducted by you. If we detect any inconsistency between the actual user of an Account and the person who owns it,
      or it is in dispute on who shall be the legitimate user of an Account, we have the right to recover, withdraw,
      suspend (freeze) or terminate such Account in our discretion, without any notice or any liability to any person.
      The loss and damage arising thereof, including but not limited to the loss of communication, data and virtual

  <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">F. For safety, compliance, operational or other concerns, and on a reasonable ground

      suspend (freeze), terminate or reclaim your Account in our sole discretion, temporarily or permanently, with or
      without notice, giving reasons or not, and without any liability to you.</span></p>

      responsible for any activity or content that is made or provided by the users; however, we expect the users to

      are granting us the right to use your User-Generated Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third
      party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work

  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or
      author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license
      you grant through these Terms in your User-Generated Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your
      compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music
      publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth
      in these Terms in your User-Generated Content or have such music publisher enter into these Terms with us. Just
      because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses
      in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible
      for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your
      record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your

  <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c15">Class Action Waiver.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Any Claim must be brought in the
      respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
      collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties
      expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the
      arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an
      award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action
      Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent
      jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge
      or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims
      must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then
      the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award
      declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
      necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
      court rather than in arbitration, you and the Company each waive any right to a jury trial.</span></p>

  <p class="c9 c4"><span class="c20 c15 c37"></span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c0">The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories: 1) data on how
      the user uses our Services; 2) aggregate data on the content with which the user engages. We collect information
      to provide better Services to you—from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more
      complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or which ZAPEE videos you might like. The information
      we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy
      controls. </span></p>
  <p class="c9 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c20 c7 c18">You understand and consent that we may provide and share the information to our
      partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a
      partner in a manner that would identify you personally. </span></p>
  <p class="c9 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c0">When you are not signed in to a valid account, we use the unique identifiers tied to
      the application or device you are using to collect information. When you are signed in with a third party account,
      e.g., your Google Account, we use such a specific account to collect information. </span></p>
  <p class="c9 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c0">For greater certainty, whenever you interact with our website or apps, we automatically
      receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,
      “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to
      your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the
      Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device
      to prevent or limit your acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our

      when you use audio features, purchase activity, people with whom you communicate or share content, information
      regarding the version of our software you are using, the location from where you downloaded our software, how
      often you launch our software and which features you use. </span></p>

      URL of your request and your connection between your phone and your computer. </span></p>
  <p class="c9"><span class="c5">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Data on user

  <p class="c9"><span class="c5">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Aggregate
      statistics on content.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For example, this may include the number of contacts you have
      on your phone, how many contacts you have marked as favorites, and the number of apps, songs, videos, or other
      content you have on your phone. This information is only collected as aggregate data, without reference to you or

  <p class="c9"><span class="c5">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Hardware and
