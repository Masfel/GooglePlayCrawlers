<ol start="2">
<li>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information ( “PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
<p>PII means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). It refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information you provide to us</li>
</ul>
<p>When you engage in certain activities on the 505Games.com, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other PII (“Identity Data”). When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number (“Financial Data”). Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information we collect about you</li>
</ul>
<p>We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (“Technical Data”).</p>
<p>A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information we receive from other sources</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, service providers, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers) and may receive information about you from them. This may be combined with other information you provide to us, as described above. 505Games may also collect personal information on third party network, platform or service: by playing a 505Games game through a social network or other third party platform, or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or service via one of our products and/or Services, you are authorizing 505Games to (1) collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all personal information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform could provide to 505Games based on your settings on the third party social network or platform and (2) share any and all of your personal information with the social network or other third party platform, through the social network/third party platform’s Application Programming Interface (API). Your agreement to this takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or service via our products and/or services, and/or when you connect with, “accept” or “allow” (or similar terms) one of our applications through a social network, or other third party platform or service.</p>
<ol start="3">

<p>We will only process your PII, in accordance with applicable law, for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>creating and maintaining your Customer account,</strong>if you become our registered Customer – Identity Data;</li>

<p>Your consent, as the Data Subject, to the processing as specified in this Privacy Policy is the primary legal ground for our processing of your PII. However, there may be circumstances where we may also rely on other valid legal grounds for the processing of your PII, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>your request for content, goods or services necessitating steps including processing of your PII to be taken prior to entering into contract with you and any processing that is necessary for the performance of such contract; and</li>
<li>legitimate interests pursued by us as a business, except where such interests are overridden by your interests and fundamental rights. We will rely on this legal ground in relation to the processing set out in paragraphs above, in which we have a legitimate interest; and</li>
<li>compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, such as, for example, the processing for the purposes set out above.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>COLLECTION METHODS</li>

This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site, and to gather demographic information.</p>

We and our service partners use your PII to operate our sites and to deliver their services.

Other than as stated on the applicable public profile site, the information you upload or input to your Public Profile will default to the privacy level you choose at sign-in, and you can choose to change the privacy settings at any time.

Your resulting friends’ list, which may be accessible across 505Games sites, will be subject to this Policy. Note that the friends that you choose to include on any friends’ list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different 505Games products and Services, and may see the profiles and information you have made visible to them or to everyone.

The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PII</li>
</ol>
<p>We may transfer your PII to:</p>
<ul>
<li>third parties in countries outside the country in which it was originally collected; and</li>
<li>within the 505 Games Group (which may also involve a transfer to a country outside the country in which it was originally collected),</li>
</ul>
<p>for further processing in accordance with the purposes set out in paragraph 3 above.</p>
<p>In these circumstances we will, as required by applicable law, ensure that your privacy rights are adequately protected by appropriate technical, organisation, contractual or other lawful means including:</p>
<ul>
<li>transfers to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;</li>
<li>using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and</li>
<li>for transfers to the US, if the entity is part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact the Privacy Compliance Officer for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your PII and privacy rights in these circumstances.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>RETENTION OF PII</li>
</ol>
<p>Your PII will be retained until your last use or purchase of our services or goods and normally for a period of five years thereafter, unless longer retention is required by applicable local law or where we have a legitimate and lawful purpose to do so. However, we will not retain beyond this period any of your PII that is no longer required for the purposes set out in this Policy. The retention of your PII will be subject to periodic review.</p>
<p>We may keep an anonymised form of your PII, which will no longer refer to you, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Data protection law provides Data Subjects with numerous rights, including the right to: access, rectify, erase, restrict, transport, and object to the processing of, their PII. Data Subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority if they believe that their PII is not being processed in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>Right to make subject access request (SAR). Data Subjects may, where permitted by applicable law, request copies of their PII. If you would like to make a SAR i.e. a request for copies of the PII we hold about you, you may do so by writing to the Privacy Compliance Officer whose contact details are above. The request should make clear that a SAR is being made. You may also be required to submit a proof of your identity and a fee.</p>
<p>Right to rectification. You may request that we rectify any inaccurate and/or complete any incomplete PII.</p>
<p>Right to withdraw consent. You may, as permitted by applicable law, withdraw your consent to the processing of your PII at any time. Such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your previous consent. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, you may not be able to benefit certain service features for which the processing of your PII is essential.</p>
<p>Right to object to processing. You may, as permitted by applicable law, request that we stop processing your PII.</p>
<p>Right to erasure. You may request that we erase your PII and we will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. For example, there may be an overriding legitimate ground for keeping your PII, such as, a legal obligation that we have to comply with, or if retention is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, where applicable law permits, 505 adheres to the realistic approach adopted by certain regulatory bodies in terms of recognizing that deleting information from a system is not always a straightforward matter, including for technical reasons, and therefore we nevertheless will attempt to put such information “beyond use” even if it cannot be completely erased.&nbsp; By way of example, but not limitation, in some instances we will not be able to delete or erase certain PII from our servers Services as that third party platform account ID would be needed to access and delete the requested information stored on our services.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in such type circumstances, the following safeguards will be put into place in attempt to ensure that access to any PII remains “beyond use” including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not attempt to use the personal data in a manner that affects you in any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not grant any other organization access to the personal data;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will attempt to surround the personal data with whatever reasonable &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technical and organizational security measures are reasonable available to us; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; We commit to permanent deletion of the information if, or when, this becomes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possible, giving due consideration to technical practicalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may request that we transfer your pII TO YOU OR TO A THIRD PARTY in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>Right to request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your pii in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p>Your right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your PII. However, you do have the right to contact the relevant supervisory authority directly.</p>

<li>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</li>
</ol>
<p>At our site, you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all PII associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your PII is protected in several ways. Access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your PII resides on a secure server that only selected 505 Games personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your PII and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us.</p>
<p>As described above, in order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfilment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>

<li>GUIDELINES FOR CHILDREN</li>
</ol>
<p>By accessing the Web Site and/or Service(s), you affirm that you are more than 18 years old, are an emancipated minor, or have the consent of your parents or legal guardian and, therefore, are fully capable and competent to abide by and enter into the agreements and obligations set forth in these Terms of Services.</p>
<p>Unless stated specifically to the contrary on the applicable 505Games site, 505Games’s Services are not intended for children under 13 (“Child” or “Children”) and 505Games will not request any PII from Children. Therefore, 505Games restricts access to certain Services on age grounds. In certain jurisdictions, for certain Services and functions, 505Games may allow a Child to register for certain Services with parental approval.</p>
<p>When Children are permitted to register for a Service with parental approval, we will take additional steps to protect the Children’s privacy, including:</p>
<p>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of PII we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information</p>
<p>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection and use of PII from their Children</p>
<p>Limiting our collection of PII from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity</p>
<p>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to PII we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that PII be changed or deleted</p>
<p>More specifically, when a Child registers, (s)he must supply the e-mail address, and/or other contact information of a parent or legal guardian who will be contacted by 505Games to ask him/her to confirm, refuse to modify his/her Child’s registration. The parent/legal guardian may be asked to provide additional documentation or perform additional actions as part of the approval process as consistent with applicable law. 505Games reserves the right to refuse access to the Service pending confirmation and activation by his/her parent or guardian. 505Games reserves the right to ask for written proof of parental consent for any User or potential User of the services suspected to be a Child. Parental consent applies exclusively to the specific service for which it has been granted.</p>
<p>Certain Services are specifically designed for Children and enable Children to create their own free accounts for which 505Games collects their username or other identifier, password, date of birth (or age), photo, video, voice recording, country, zip code or other geo-locational information, and parent or guardian’s e-mail address and/or other parent or guardian contact information. Such Services sometimes offer the possibility of paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable Children to participate in more activities on the Services by making a payment. The subscription services may also allow parents or guardians to manage their Child’s account and create their own player accounts.</p>
<p>Certain Services enable Children to create personalized avatars which they can use in numerous activities in the services, including mini-games and virtual worlds. Children may also use other functions of the Services such as “Recommend to a friend” to invite a friend to find out about the Services. The “Recommend to a friend” functions enable Children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the related service. 505Games will collect the first name and e-mail address of your Child (or, failing that, the e-mail address of the parent or guardian) and the e-mail address of his/her friend for the sole purpose of sending a single message. This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we do not reveal your child’s e-mail address to the recipient.</p>
<p>Parents may delete their Child’s account or change their Child’s privacy settings at any time by sending an e-mail to the Privacy Compliace Officer, who is identified above in section 1. The deletion request will be processed within thirty (30) days of the date of which we receive it.</p>
<p>In all cases, use of the Services by Children must take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them. AS FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGISLATION, 505GAMES DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE CONDUCTED BY CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU GIVE YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OR OTHER OF THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR CHILD.</p>
