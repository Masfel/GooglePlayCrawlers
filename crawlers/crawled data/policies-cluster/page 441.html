		<p>
			We at <span class="appName"></span> know you care about how your personal information is used and
			shared, and we take your privacy
			seriously.&nbsp; Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using or accessing the
			Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy
			Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
			<br><br>Remember that your use of <span class="appName"></span>'s Services is at all times subject
			to the Terms of Use, which
			incorporates this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the
			definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.
		</p>
		<h3>What does this privacy policy cover?</h3>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information")
			that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don't
			own or control, or people that we don't manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our
			users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with
			our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user
			account, to contact you, to fulfill your requests, and to analyze how you use the Services.

		</p>
		<h3>Will <span class="appName"></span> ever change this privacy policy?</h3>
		<p>
			We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to
			time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice in our mobile applications, by sending
			you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice
			emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern
			your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the
			Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the
			changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
			information is collected.
		</p>
		<h3>What Information Do We Collect? </h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Information You Provide to Us: </strong>
			<br><br>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the
			registration process, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address and phone number,
			Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
			<br><br>We may communicate with you if you've provided us the means to do so. For example, if you've given
			us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you
			about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This
			confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do
			not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the unsubscribe link
			at the bottom of the email.
			<br><br><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong>
			<br><br>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our
			server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie”
			information, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Services, the page or feature you
			requested and the Content that you have already accessed. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your
			browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and
			features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on
			your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you
			from taking advantage of some of our features.

			to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren't

			may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties
			may not honor "Do Not Track" requests you have set using your browser or device.

			patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users
			use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to
			as many users as possible.

			your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:

			provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from
			you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that
			they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or
			de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that
			would identify you as an individual person.

			we're affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the
			Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with
			such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business
			only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service We have no control over the policies
			and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take

			is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances,
			and would be subject to the terms of the “ Information that's been de-identified” section in that regard.
			<br><br><strong>User Profiles and Submissions: </strong>Certain user profile information, including your
			name may be displayed to other users; for example, if you choose to share a comment on a particular story.
			Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in
			your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that
			any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you
			voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (e.g. comment sections) becomes publicly
			available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your name may also be displayed to other users if and
			when you make comments through the Services.

			transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also,

			change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third
			party.

			and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order;
