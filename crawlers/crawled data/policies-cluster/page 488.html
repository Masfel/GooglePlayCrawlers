        <h2><strong>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>§1 Scope of application</strong></h3>
<p>(1) These terms and conditions govern the use of the YAZIO application (app). They apply regardless of whether the app is used free of charge or for a fee.</p>
<p>(2) Only the following terms and conditions apply between YAZIO GmbH (hereinafter “Provider”) and the user (hereinafter “User”) as amended at the time of use.</p>
<h3><strong>§2 Definition of terms</strong></h3>
<p>(1) The term “YAZIO App” refers to the programme entitled “YAZIO” sold under the name “YAZIO”. This programme can be installed and operated on devices such as mobile telephones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices.</p>
<p>(2) The terms “Consumer” and “Entrepreneur” correspond to the legal definitions in Sections 13, 14 German Civil Code (BGB). The User is thus the “Consumer” insofar as the use or purchase of the YAZIO App cannot be assigned primarily to the User’s commercial or self-employed professional activity. In contrast, “Entrepreneur” refers to any natural or legal person or partnership with legal capacity that acts in exercise of its trade, business or profession when using the YAZIO App or entering into the contract.</p>
<p>(3) “Market place” refers to the shops (stores) of Market place operators such as Google (“Google Play”) or Apple (“App Store”) where the User can select and download the YAZIO App to be installed on the User’s device.</p>
<h3><strong>§3 Available types of use</strong></h3>
<p>The YAZIO App can be operated free of charge or for a fee. The app is always free of charge when installed - e.g. via the Google or Apple Market places. Use for a fee always requires special, express consent by the User in the app (“in-app-purchase”, see below § 4).</p>
<h3><strong>§4 Use of the YAZIO App, in-app purchases</strong></h3>
<p>(1) The User can select and install the YAZIO App in the respective Market place. By installing the app, the User accepts these General Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>(2) A user account is required to use the YAZIO App; this in turn requires that the User enters an email address and a password.</p>
<p>(3) If the User would like to use the wide range of features offered by the pay version of the YAZIO App, the User can upgrade through the so-called “in-app purchase”. The upgrade mechanism may differ depending on the Market place platform; please refer to the respective Market place operator’s terms and conditions to determine the course of action required. The purchase contract is subject to the conditions of the respective Market place. Those conditions also determine whether the purchase contract is concluded between the User and the Market place or between the User and YAZIO GmbH.</p>
<p>(4) In-app purchases are billed by the respective Market place. The payment terms stipulated by the respective Market place operator apply.</p>
<h3><strong>§5 Warranty for defects of quality, guarantee</strong></h3>
<p>Provided that the purchase contract between the Provider and the User is effected, the Provider is liable for defects in the app in line with the applicable statutory provisions, particularly pursuant to the general provisions of Sections 434 et. seqq. German Civil Code (BGB). The warranty period for the app made available to Entrepreneurs by the Provider is twelve months.</p>
<h3><strong>§6 Liability</strong></h3>
<p>(1) User claims to compensation for damages are excluded. This does not include a user’s claims to compensation of damages for injury to life or limb, health or damages caused by breach of material contractual obligations or liability for other damage caused by a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty by the Provider, its legal representatives or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are those obligations that are required to achieve the objective of the contract.</p>
<p>(2) If material contractual obligations are violated, the Provider is only liable for the typical foreseeable damage if such damage was caused by ordinary negligence, unless the User’s claim for compensation of damages is based on an injury to life, limb or health.</p>
<p>(3) The limitations of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall also apply in favour of the Provider’s legal representatives or vicarious agents if claims are asserted directly against such persons.</p>
<h3><strong>§7 Instructions on right of withdrawal</strong></h3>
<p>(1) If the contract is entered into with the Provider (and not the Market place operator), the User has a statutory right of withdrawal against the Provider, as explained in detail under (2). Exceptions to the right of withdrawal are stated under (3). The sample withdrawal form is available under (4).</p>
<p>(2) Instructions on right of withdrawal</p>
<p><em>Right of withdrawal<br></em>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without reason. The period for the right of withdrawal amounts to fourteen days from the day the contract was concluded. In order to exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (YAZIO GmbH [address, e-mail, telephone, fax]) in a clear statement of your decision to withdraw from this contract (e.g. by sending a letter by post, fax or email). You may use the enclosed sample withdrawal form, but this is not mandatory. The withdrawal deadline is deemed met if the letter stating your decision to use your right of withdrawal is dispatched before the withdrawal deadline expires.</p>
<p><em>Consequences of the notice of withdrawal<br></em>If you withdraw from this contract, we must return any and all payments that we have received from you without undue delay and at the latest within fourteen days from the day on which we received your letter stating your withdrawal. We use the same means of payment for this repayment as you used for the original transaction, unless we have explicitly agreed something else; under no circumstances will we charge you a fee for this repayment.</p>
<p>(3) The right to withdraw from any purchase made via the YAZIO App ends when the Provider has begun to perform the contract, i.e. has begun providing the payable functionalities of the YAZIO App after the User has expressly consented to the Provider beginning to perform the contract before the period for the right of withdrawal has expired, and the User has confirmed that it is aware that it loses its right to withdraw upon performance.</p>
<p>(4) Sample withdrawal form</p>
<p>(If you wish to withdraw from the contract, please fill in this form and send it back to us).</p>
<p>— To: help@yazio.com<br>OR<br>— To: YAZIO GmbH, Kartäuserstr. 13a, 99084 Erfurt, Germany<br>— I/we withdraw (*) from the contract I/we (*) entered into concerning the purchase of the following goods (*)/the performance of the following service (*)<br>— ordered on (*)/received on (*)<br>— Consumer’s name<br>— Consumer’s address<br>— Consumer's e-mail address used for YAZIO registration<br>— Consumer’s signature (only if notification is made in writing)<br>— date<br>(*) delete as applicable</p>
<h3><strong>§8 Final provisions</strong></h3>
<p>(1) Contracts entered into between the User and the Provider are subject to the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Statutory provisions limiting the choice of law and the application of mandatory provisions, especially of the state where the User as the Consumer has its habitual abode, remain unaffected.</p>
<p>(2) If the User is an Entrepreneur, a legal person under public law or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes under the contractual relationships between the User and the Provider shall be the registered office of the Provider.</p>
<p>(3) If individual items are legally invalid, the remainder of the contract shall remain valid. Whenever such provisions exist, the statutory provisions shall replace the invalid provisions. If this would constitute undue hardship for one of the contracting parties, the entire contract shall be deemed invalid.</p>

<h3><strong>7) Use of web analysis, remarketing and retargeting tools</strong></h3>
<p>Based on our legitimate interests in terms of point (f) of Art. 6 (1) GDPR, we use various tools or plugins to conduct web analysis, remarketing, and retargeting in order to optimise our online offering and to be able to compile more relevant offers for you.</p>
<p>These services use cookies, forward the IP address and/or record and analyse various types of data, including the number of website visitors, duration of the visit, average page loading time and origin of the visitors.</p>
<p>Detailed information:</p>
<h4><strong>7.1) Google Analytics</strong></h4>
<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service offered by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies that help to analyse how visitors use the website. The information generated by the cookie about the way you use the website (including your IP address) will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. YAZIO has activated IP anonymisation by adding the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” on the websites, meaning that Google will shorten your IP address within a member state of the EU or another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand (this procedure is called IP masking). Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating the way you use the website, compiling reports on website activity for YAZIO and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.</p>
<p>Google offers an add-on for web browsers that serves to prevent data collection by Google Analytics and data processing by Google. The add-on can be downloaded and installed at your own risk from <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>7.2) Firebase Analytics</strong></h4>
<p>We use Firebase Analytics for the YAZIO App. Firebase Analytics is a service offered by Google Inc. domiciled in 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>The Firebase Analytics service helps to determine the interactions of App users by recording, for instance, the first time the App is opened, deinstallations, updates, system crashes and how often the App is used. The service also records and analyses certain user interests. The information processed via Google Firebase may also be used together with other Google services, such as Google Analytics and the Google marketing services. The tool uses identifiers like the Android Advertising ID or the Advertising Identifier for iOS and cookie-like technologies to identify the users’ mobile devices.</p>

<p>The YAZIO App further uses the Crashlytics analysis programme offered by Fabric, a company belonging to Google Inc. domiciled in 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Crashlytics provides us with information on unforeseen system crashes and other malfunctions, thus serving our legitimate interest to constantly improve the App and eliminate faults. When a fault occurs, the analysis programme records and transmits information on the device in use, the operating system, the version and functionality of the App, time of the crash and the anonymised IP address of the requesting device. For more information, go to the information provided by Crashlytics at <a href="https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf</a>.

<h3><strong>8) Social Media plugins</strong></h3>
<p>Based on our legitimate interests in terms of point (f) of Art. 6 (1), we use various Social Media plugins to conduct web analysis, remarketing, and retargeting in order to optimise our online offering and to be able to compile more relevant offers for you.</p>
<h4><strong>8.1) Facebook</strong></h4>
<p>We use the Social Media plugin of Facebook.com operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). Such plugins may constitute interaction elements or content (e.g. videos, graphics or text) and are marked with one of the Facebook logos (white “f” in a blue tile, the terms “Like” or the “thumbs up” sign) or are labelled “Facebook Social Plugin”. For a list and illustrations of the Facebook Social Plugins, please go to: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a></p>
<p>A direct connection is established with the Facebook servers whenever a user accesses a feature on this website that contains such a plugin. Facebook transmits the plugin content directly to the user’s device, which is then incorporated into the online offering. In this context, the processed data may by used to compile user profiles. We therefore have no influence whatsoever on the scope of the data collected by Facebook with the help of this plugin. The information we provide to our users is based on what we know.</p>
<p>By incorporating the plugin, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the website. If the user is logged into Facebook, Facebook can attribute the website visit to that user’s Facebook account. Whenever a user interacts with a plugin, for instance by clicking the Like button or writing a comment, the user’s device transmits the corresponding information to Facebook directly, where it is stored. Facebook may even find out and store the IP address of users who are not registered with Facebook. According to Facebook, they only store anonymised IP addresses in Germany.</p>
<p>The Facebook privacy policy is available at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy</a>&nbsp;and gives more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and further data processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as the corresponding rights and setting options to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Users, who are registered with Facebook, but who do not wish Facebook to collect data concerning him or her via this website and to combine such data with the membership data stored by Facebook, must log out of Facebook before using our website and must delete their cookies. Additional settings as well as the possibility to object to the use of data for marketing purposes are available can be found in the Facebook user settings: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>&nbsp;or at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>&nbsp;for the US and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>&nbsp;for the EU.</p>
<p>The settings are platform-independent, meaning that they will be assumed for all devices, whether desktop computers or mobile devices.</p>

<h3><strong>9) Erasure of your data</strong></h3>
<p>YAZIO stores personal data concerning users as long as the App is used. When the user account is deleted, we will finally and irrevocably erase the email address, first name, surname, profile image and links to third party providers.</p>
<h3><strong>10) How to reset your account</strong></h3>
<p>Users can reset their accounts. In this case, we will use a transparent procedure to set up a new account to which the settings are copied (email address, password, settings, targets, etc.). The email address, first name, surname and, if applicable, Fitbit ID, Polar ID, Stripe ID and AppsFlyer data linked to the original account are erased in this account.</p>
<h3><strong>11) Your rights</strong></h3>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us using the contact details in item 1 at any time if your have questions regarding your rights and other topics surrounding personal data.</p>
<p>You have the following rights:</p>
<h4><strong>11.1) Right of access</strong></h4>
<p>You have the right to request, free of charge at any time, information regarding the personal data concerning you that is stored by YAZIO, the origin and recipients of such data, the purpose of data processing, the planned duration of data storage and a copy of the personal data that are being processed (Art. 15 GDPR).&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>11.2) Right to rectification</strong></h4>
<p>You further have the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data and to have incomplete personal data completed (Art. 16 GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.3) Right to withdraw consent</strong></h4>
<p>You have the right to withdraw, without stating reasons, your consent to data processing at any time with effect to future processing (Art. 7 (3) GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.4) Right to erasure</strong></h4>
<p>You have the right to obtain erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay if the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed or if you withdraw your consent to lawful processing and there are no other legal grounds for the processing. If you object to data processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, your data will also be erased. Finally, your data will be erased if processing is unlawful for any other statutory reasons (Art. 17 GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.5) Right to restriction of processing</strong></h4>
<p>You have the right to obtain restriction of processing if you contest the accuracy of the personal data for a period of time that enables us to review the accuracy.</p>
<p>Data processing is also restricted if processing is unlawful but you refuse erasure of the personal data concerning you and instead of requesting erasure, you request restriction of processing, or if we no longer need the personal data for the corresponding purposes, but we need them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or if you had previously objected against processing but it has not yet been established whether YAZIO has legitimate grounds to store the personal data that override your interests (Art. 18 &nbsp;GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.6) Right to data portability </strong></h4>
<p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller where the processing is based on consent and the data is processed by automated means (Art. 20 GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.7) Right to object</strong></h4>
<p>Finally, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you in the future.</p>
<p>You have the right to object at any time to the compilation of user profiles and to the processing of the corresponding personal data concerning you where processing is based on consent. The personal data concerning you will no longer be processed where no compelling legitimate grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms. Where the personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you naturally have the right to object to such processing at any time (Art.&nbsp; 21 GDPR).</p>
<h4><strong>11.8) Right to lodge a complaint</strong></h4>
<p>You further have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR).</p>
<h3><strong>12) Validity and updates</strong></h3>
<p>The Data Privacy Policy is currently valid and was prepared on 25 May 2018. Further developments of our website might make it necessary to amend this Data Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend the Data Privacy Policy at any time with future effect.</p>
