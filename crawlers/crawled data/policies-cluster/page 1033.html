            <p>Some jurisdictions’ laws grant specific rights to users of the Game Services, which are set out in this section.</p>
            <p><strong>This section entitled “Your Rights” applies to users that are located in a Relevant Jurisdiction and Switzerland.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The sub-sections entitled “Access”, “Correction”, and “Erasure” also apply to users that are located in Algeria, Brazil or Morocco. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>The sub-sections entitled “Access”, “Correction” and “Withdrawal of Consent” (set out in the jurisdiction-specific terms below) apply to users that are located in India. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>The sub-sections entitled “Access”, “Correction”, “Erasure” and “Objection” apply to users that are located in Qatar or Russia.</strong></p>
            <p>You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at <a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabetacom</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please contact us at <a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabeta.com</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Portability</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., survey information) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., game play statistics), as described above in the section “<strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong>”. You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party, with certain exceptions. We will provide further information to you about this if you make such a request.</p>
            <p>If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (for example, where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property). </p>
            <p><strong>Correction</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to correct any of your personal information we hold that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information we hold about you by logging into your Game account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabeta.com</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Erasure</strong></p>
            <p>You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please contact us at <a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabeta.com</a>.</p>
            <p>We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too. </p>
            <p><strong>Restriction of Processing to Storage Only</strong></p>
            <p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too. </p>
            <p><strong>Objection</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. We will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below by&nbsp;contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabeta.com</a>.</p>
            <p>To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us for certain processing activities by contacting us at <a href="javascript:;">dpo@proximabeta.com</a>.Where consent is required to process your personal information, if you do not consent to the processing or if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to deliver the expected service. </p>
