<p dir="ltr">
Our Services are intended and offered for private, personal and
non-commercial use only and we reserve the right to cease and suspend the
Services and to terminate your membership if we suspect that your use of
the Application and/or the Website is for commercial purposes. You agree,
declare and undertake not to demand any compensation under any name, if

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Our service options:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Free Membership: You may access our Services which do not require payment
(“Free Services”) through “Free Membership”. We may suspend, change, limit,
or terminate the Free Membership for any reason at any time without notice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Premium Membership: You may access our Services which require payment
(“Paid Services”) through a “Paid Subscription” and become a “Premium
Member” for a specified period or for recurring periods. Premium Membership
may be purchased directly from us or through a third party either by paying
a subscription fee in advance on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual
or any other recurring interval (“Recurring Subscription Fee”) or by
purchasing a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or
sold by us or on behalf of us (“Code”) for access to Paid Services for a
specific time period (“Pre-Paid Fee”).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
If you have purchased Premium Membership or commenced a Trial through a
Code, additional terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code
may also apply. In that case, you agree to comply with such terms and
conditions, in addition to this Member Contract.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
When a Paid Subscription is purchased through a third party, such third
party’s terms and conditions may apply to your Paid Subscription, along
with the provisions of this Member Contract or any other applicable terms
and conditions.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Price Changes:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
The price of the Paid Subscription may be changed at any time and you will
be notified when the price of a Paid Subscription increases. If required,
we will seek your consent to continue with the increased price.
</p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
In any case, the price change will take effect at the start of the
following subscription period which follows the date of the price change.
In case you do not agree with the price change, you may always reject the
price change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription within the
subscription period.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
Automatically Recurring Subscriptions and How to Cancel Them:
</p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
If you are using the Paid Services through the payment of a Recurring
Subscription Fee, the payment shall be renewed automatically at the end of
the then-current subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid
Subscription before the end of the subscription period by sending your
request to <a href="mailto:hello@meditopia.com">hello@meditopia.com</a> if
you purchased the Paid Subscription through us, or if you purchased the
Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription
through such third party, such as Google Play Store and Apple App Store. We
would like you to know that such cancellation will take effect at the end
of the then-current subscription period and you will not be refunded for
the subscription period which you have cancelled your Paid Subscription
within. To avoid any discrepancies, you will not receive a refund for the
Subscription Fee you already paid for your current subscription period and
you will continue to receive the Paid Services ordered until the end of
your current subscription period.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
WE MUST REMIND YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION
THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL DIRECTLY WITH THAT THIRD PARTY, SUCH
AS GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND APPLE APP STORE.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
Trials:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
From time to time me may offer you trials of Premium Memberships for a
specific period (“Trial Period”), without payment. Any Trial or other
promotion that provides access to the Paid Services must be used within the
specified Trial Period. We or third parties may require you to provide your
payment details in order for you to be eligible for any Trial. BY PROVIDING
YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR
THE SPECIFIED SUBSCRIPTION FEE UNLESS YOU CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID
SUBSCRIPTION WITHIN THE TRIAL PERIOD. If you have received your Trial
through us by signing up for the Trial through the Website, you may contact
us through <a href="mailto:hello@meditopia.com">hello@meditopia.com</a> to
cancel your paid subscription. If you signed up for the Trial through the
Application, you actually received your Trial through a third-party, either
Google Play Store or Apple App Store. In that case you must cancel the
applicable paid subscription through the third party, in line with the
cancellation and refund policies of such third party.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
If you have received your Trial through us and cancelled your applicable
paid subscription within the Trial Period but you have inadvertently
charged for Premium Membership, you should contact us at
hello@meditopia.com
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
Special Offers, Campaigns and Promotions:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
We may provide and organize various campaigns and offer certain promotions,
such as discounts, gifts, deals or other offers through the Website or the
Application from time to time (“Promotions”). The separate terms and
conditions of such Promotions, along with this Terms and any other terms
and conditions which may apply, will be determined by us and apply to your
participation in such Promotion. We reserve the right to make any changes
to any Promotion and/or to suspend such Promotion both before and during
such Promotion is in effect, without notice.
</p>

termination, the Company, its affiliates or third-party business partners,
within the scope of the your consent, and without your prior authorization,
may send messages with information, marketing and/or commercial purposes

as the distributor and handles refunds themselves. You accept and
acknowledge that we cannot make a refund for purchases conducted through
Apple App Store. For more information on Apple’s refund process please

</p>
<br>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
Billing
</p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr">
We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) in order
to receive your payments for purchases made through us. The processing of
such payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies
of the Payment Processor in addition to this Member Contract. We shall be
not liable for any damages caused by the Payment Processor. By making a
purchase through us, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor,
all charges at prices in effect on the date of purchase and/or on dates the
subscription renews automatically, for any use of such Paid Services in
accordance with the applicable payment terms, and authorize us, through the
Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (“Payment
Method”).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
You must provide up-to-date, complete and accurate information for the
billing (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit
card expiration date) and must promptly notify us or our Payment Processor
if your Payment Method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you
become aware of a potential breach of security, such as an unauthorized
disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such
information may be made at Apple App Store or Google Play Store security
page depending on purchase.
