<p>New Story Inc. Privacy Policy</p>



<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>



<p>New Story Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy (“Privacy policy”) explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you use one or more of our mobile applications (the “App”, “our App”) and explains how we and some of the companies we cooperate processing that information.</p>



<p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.</p>



<p>Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”). If you do not want us to collect, store, use or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play our apps or use our services.</p>



<p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller.</p>



<p><strong>Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully to learn more about how we process your personal information. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. By accessing or using the App, you consent to the processing of your personal data provided to us in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>



<p>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</p>



<p>Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Apps or interact with third party ads in our Apps or with our ads in other publisher’s apps. These information are collected through SDKs (Software Development Kits) which are technical tools integrated into our Apps. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our apps and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us or which you allow us to access when you connect to your social network accounts through our Apps. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information). We will sometimes use third party advertising companies to help us collect this data. Further information is provided below in the section titled “Third party advertising companies”.</p>



<p>A. TECHNICAL INFORMATION</p>



<p>We collect technical information about your device that are necessary for you to use our App and additional technical data that enables us to maintain and analyze the functioning of the App, to personalize the content of the App, and to display advertisements. Such information includes amongst others the type of device(s) you are using to play our Apps, persistent identifiers, such as IP address, device identifiers, ad identifiers, unique user ID specific for our Apps, and the country or region that you are playing in.</p>



<p>B. ADVERTISING AND APPLICATION USAGE INFORMATION</p>



<p>When you use our Apps, we collect additional information from you by using persistent identifiers that permit identification of your device. We collect information about how you play our Apps, how you interact with our ads in other publisher’s apps and how you interact with third party ads that are shown to you in our Apps. Such information is used for delivering and improving our service, advertising, cross-promotion and analytics purposes.</p>



<p>C. CLASSICAL PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>



<p>We do not collect classical personal information through our Apps (such as you name, address, email or phone number) and you can use our Apps without providing us with your classical personal information. We will receive your classical personal information (such as you name, address, email or phone number) only when you contact us directly and will use such information only to respond to your inquiry. We may ask you to submit and we may process other non-personally identifiable information that may be personal to you such as your age range, year of birth and gender, provided that year of birth and gender information is collected solely for users who have passed the age gate in our Apps.</p>



<p>III. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>



<p>We, or our service providers, primarily use the information we collect and store to improve the experience of our users, but we will also use that information for other purposes, including:</p>



<p>● Operate and improve our Services;</p>
