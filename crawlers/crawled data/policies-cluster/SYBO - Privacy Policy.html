					"text": "</b>Information you provide to us</b><br/><br/>We collect information you provide voluntarily to us, such as when you participate in a contest and promotion, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, send us an email or otherwise interact with us. The types of information we may collect about you include your name, social networking screen names or IDs, email address and any other information you choose to provide. <br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Information we collect automatically</b><br/><br/>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information from you and/or your device (which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws). We collect this information with your either your explicit consent in accordance with GDPR article 6(1)(a) or as part of our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR article 6 (1)(f)., including:<br/><br/>• Age: when you download our game, we collect your age as indicated by you.<br/><br/>• Log Information: about your use of our Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<br/><br/>• Device information: about the device you use to access our Services, including information about the device’s type, software and hardware, Media Access Control (“MAC”) address and other unique device identifiers (such as Device ID and Advertising ID), device token, mobile network information and time zone.<br/><br/>• Location information: We collect location information in order to comply with legislation and policies that apply to your area. However, neither we nor our partners collect location information more granular than city level without your explicit consent.<br/><br/>• Usage information: relating to your use of our Services, including which applications you use and your interactions with other users.<br/><br/>• Consumption information: about your consumption habits relating to your use of our Services, including which purchases you make with both virtual and real currencies.<br/><br/>• Other Information: collected by cookies and other tracking technologies: we use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your computer’s hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our Services and your experience and see which areas and features of our Services are popular. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.<br/><br/>• Information from third parties: We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you log into our Services by using a third party site or platform such as Facebook and any other social media, we may access information about you from that site or platform, such as your screen name, profile information, including picture, and friend lists, in accordance with the authorisation procedures determined by such third party site or platform. We may also collect information from app stores when you download or update one of our applications. We may also receive personal information about you from other third-party service providers and advertising partners.<br/><br/>• Information from third party surverys: We may invite you to participate in surveys facilitated by third party survey partners. From these services we will collect the information you provide as well as you userID in order to be able to match it with your in-game information. You will always be made aware that you are being transfered to the third party service before the collection starts and thus have the opportunity to opt out. The partners policies will be made available to you and we encourage you to review them before participating in the survey.<br/><br/><b>Ad Networks</b><br/><br/>We may feature advertising in our Services via showing third party advertisements in our Services, as well as advertise our own Services via third parties. <br/><br/>SYBO may disclose your personal information to advertising networks for the purpose of their direct marketing. Thus, we may send your advertising ID and IP address to ad networks to enable our partners to serve appropriate ads in accordance with GDPR article 6(1)(f). \"Advertising ID\" means the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple, and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that SYBO and our advertising network partners use for interest-based advertising (targeted). They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. These identifiers are used by ad networks for a number of purposes, in addition to targeted advertisement, thus we encourage you to check the Privacy Policies of our partners. You can find a list of SYBO’s existing advertising networks partners and other third-party service providers by clicking <a href=\"https://www.sybogames.com/third-party-data-controllers-and-processors/ \">here</a>. These advertising networks may be located in countries outside EU/EEA that have less restrictive data protection legislation. For such advertising networks in countries outside EU/EEA, the legal basis for the transfer is always in accordance with one of the lawful instruments set forth I GDPR article 44-50. You can opt out of all third-party targeted advertisements, for all apps, using the device-level opt our settings on your device. If you use an Apple device, a guide for opting out can be found <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 \">here</a>. If you use an Android device, navigate to the Google Settings page, select Ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of targeted ads.<br/><br/>We may allow third parties to provide analytics services in connection with our Services.

You may disable location-based services at any time by adjusting the settings of your mobile device.<br/><br/>Adnetworks may use information about you, such as your advertising ID, to identify users who are likely to have an interest in our services and display advertising to them.

<p>A cookie is a small datafile that is saved on your computer, tablet or mobile phone. A cookie is not a program that can contain harmful programs or viruses.</p> 

<h2>How/why the homepage uses cookies</h2>

<p>Cookies are necessary for the homepage to function. Cookies help us get an overview of your visit to the homepage so that we can continually optimise and adjust the homepage to your requirements and interests. For example, cookies remember what you might have added to a shopping cart, if you have previously visited the page, if you are logged in and what languages and currency you want displayed on the homepage. We also use cookies to target our ads to you on other homepages. On a very general level, cookies are used as part of our services in order to show content that is as relevant as possible to you.</p>

<h2>How long are cookies saved?</h2>

<p>How long cookies are saved on your device can vary. The time when they are scheduled to expire is calculated from the last date you visited the homepage. When cookies expire, they are automatically deleted. You can view a complete list of cookies below.</p>

<h2>This is how you can reject or delete your cookies</h2>

<p>You can always reject cookies on your computer, tablet or phone by changing your browser settings. Where these settings can be found depends on the type of browser you are using. If you do change the settings, please be aware that there will be some functions and services that you cannot use because they rely on the homepage being able to remember the choices you have made.<br>

You can choose to not receive cookies from Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Deleting cookies</h2>

<p>You can delete cookies that you have previously accepted. If you are using a PC with a recent version of a browser, you can delete your cookies by using these shortcut keys: CTRL + SHIFT + Delete.</p>

<p>If the shortcut keys do not work and/or you are using an Apple computer, you must find out what browser you are using and then click on the relevant link:</p>
