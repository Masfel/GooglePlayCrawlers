                Immediately upon registration, the user’s email address is turned into an encrypted format, a “one way
                hash”, which we can’t read and which is used to authenticate the user login process. We do not permanently
                store the email addresses of users in a recoverable format because we do not retain the email addresses of
                users in a usable form after initial registration. We have no means of initiating contact with such users by
                email after registration. The user name of registered users is not used as a means to contact such users. We
                do not collect more personal data than is necessary to respond to a question or one-off request from a user.

                information collected from children without parental consent. Parents are invited to review their children’s
                information by contacting us.
