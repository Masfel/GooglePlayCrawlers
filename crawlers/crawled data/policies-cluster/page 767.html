<ul>
  <li>

Once we receive and verify your consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records.  However, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers under certain circumstances, which will be explained to you at the time of the denial, if any. </p>
<h3>Right to opt-out </h3>
<p>You have the right to opt-out of “sale” of your personal information, as defined by the CCPA. In certain circumstances we may share your information with our partners, who help us deliver advertisements in our games tailored to your interests.
