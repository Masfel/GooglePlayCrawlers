This Privacy Policy applies to all Websites and Services, whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or otherwise. Note, however, this Privacy Policy does not apply to use of unaffiliated websites that link to our Websites. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.</p>
<p><strong>B. PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY </strong><br>
This Privacy Policy aims to give you information on how PSafe collects and uses your Personal Information through your use of the Websites, including any information you may provide through the Services or Websites when you sign up for an account, sign up to receive information or communications from us, purchase a product or service, or request further services or information from us.</p>
<p>It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or using Personal Information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information. This Privacy Policy supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p>
<p><strong>C. CHILDREN</strong><br>
The Services and Websites are not designed for, or directed to, children under the age of 16 and PSafe does not knowingly collect information of individuals under the age of 16. If PSafe discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information from anyone younger than the age of 16, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services. If you are under 16, please do not register an account, make any purchases, or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.

The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, and is active only while you are connected to the Websites or Services.</li>
<li><strong>Third parties or publicly available sources.</strong> We may receive Personal Information about you from various third parties. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. Examples of third-party sources include:
<ul>
<li>Technical Information from analytics providers;</li>

<strong>IV. THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS &amp; AD SERVERS; ONLINE TRACKING</strong><br>
PSafe works with certain third parties (including ad networks, ad agencies, and analytics companies, collectively “Advertising Partners” and each an “Advertising Partner”) to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, to serve advertisements, including our advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These third parties may use Technical Information, Online Identifiers, Internet and Network Information, Profile Information, Usage Data, Marketing and Communications Information, Location Information and related information to compile reports on user activity. For example, if you clicked on one of our advertisements that led you to our Websites or Services, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and pixel tags) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Technical Information, Online Identifiers, Internet and Network Information, Profile Information, Usage Data, Marketing and Communications Information, Location Information and related information about you. Cookies and pixel tags, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you, and assist in providing analytics.</p>
<p>These third parties may also transfer information collected about you to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process analytics information on their behalf. Each of these third party’s ability to use and share information collected about you is restricted by their respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these third parties in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of third-party analytics services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@psafe.com">privacy@psafe.com</a>.</p>
<p>We may share Technical Information, Online Identifiers, , Internet and Network Information, Profile Information, Usage Data, Marketing and Communications Information, Location Information and related information about visitors with third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors to help analyze how users use the Websites and Services. These analytics services may use their own software development kits (SDKs) to collect information such as how often and what features of the Websites and Services users use. We use this information to improve the Websites and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their respective terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.</p>
<p>While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members and DAA Self-Regulatory Program participating companies, you may visit:</p>

We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, provided that we may contact you in regards to such feedback.</p>
<p><strong>C. COOKIES </strong><br>
A cookie is a data file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by the user before the expiration date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to better understand how individuals are using our Websites and Services; cookies will not be used for other purposes unrelated to the operations of PSafe.</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.

<p><a name="VI"></a><br>
<strong>VI. HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, in our discretion and without restriction.</p>
<p>PSafe may disclose Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, PSafe may share Personal Information as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A. INTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</strong><br>
We may share some or all of users’ Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control for a variety of purposes, including for business, operational, and marketing purposes. PSafe may, and reserves the right to, share your information with any other company that is not presently, but becomes, a PSafe parent, subsidiary, or affiliate.</p>

If you agree at that time to receive such communications, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties). For more information, please refer to the Marketing Communications section.</p>
<p><strong>B. EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES<br>
</strong><br>
<em>Other Users</em></p>
<p>Whenever you create and populate a “shared album” or mark files (“Shared Content”) to share with third-parties in the <em>dfndr vault</em> application, PSafe automatically will upload such Shared Content (which may include Personal Information) to servers managed by PSafe (located in the United States) to permit such sharing with those other users of <em>dfndr vault</em> identified by you. Users of&nbsp;<em>dfndr vault</em> who accept your invitation to view such Shared Content (or the user who posted the Shared Content, if re-downloading to their own device) automatically will receive a download (in their <em>dfndr vault</em> application) of the shared files in their original sizes.</p>
<p><em>Administrative &amp; Legal Third Parties</em></p>
<p>PSafe cooperates with the relevant authorities and with third parties to ensure compliance with the law, for example in areas such as protection of industrial property rights and intellectual property, privacy and personal data protection, fraud prevention and others.</p>
<p>We may transfer and disclose information, including Personal Information, to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>to comply with a valid legal inquiry, investigation, or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order, or if in our opinion such disclosure is required by law;</li>
<li>to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, manage risks, obtain professional advice, or establish, exercise or defend legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure;</li>
<li>to protect the safety, interests, rights, property or security of PSafe, you, or any third party;</li>
<li>to respond to a breach or attempted breach of the security of our Websites or Services;</li>
<li>to defend or assert our legal rights pursuant to any of the Terms of Use, any policies applicable to the Services, or any other agreement you may have with PSafe; or</li>
<li>at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use Technical Information to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies in our discretion.</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Service Providers</em></p>
<p>We may share users’ Personal Information with service providers or “outsourced” companies that improve or facilitate PSafe’s operations or provide services on our behalf such as (but not limited to) transport services, call centers, or loyalty programs, among others. Nevertheless, the user agrees that PSafe is not responsible for the misuse of the user’s personal information by these companies or websites. In some cases, these service providers collect information directly from the user (for example, in the case of purchases through app stores, or requests to conduct surveys or studies). In such cases, the user will receive a notification about the participation of a service provider in such activities and the user will have complete discretion over what information the user wants to provide. To facilitate such situations, and to take care of any additional information directly provided to such service providers, such service providers will use the information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Payment Processing</em></p>
<p>As of the date of this Privacy Policy, all online payments for the Services are handled by either Google Play (<a href="https://play.google.com/store">https://play.google.com/store</a>) or the App Store (<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/">https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/</a>), depending on the user’s device. We do not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information, and all transactions conducted on Google Play and the App Store are subject to their respective terms of service available at <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html">https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html</a>.&nbsp; For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a> (for Android devices) or <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</a> (for Apple devices).</p>
<p><em>Third-Party Cloud Storage Providers</em></p>
<p>As described in the License Agreement, certain Services allow you to “connect” such Services to an account with the following third-party cloud storage providers: Dropbox, Google, and OneDrive (each, a “Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider”). You agree that the information and/or Personal Information you provide to activate and/or use the connection to the Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider, as well as any content or data you have chosen to store (which may include Personal Information) using the Services, may be shared with that Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider. You further agree to be bound by that Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider’s practices with respect to your information and/or Personal Information. You also agree to be bound by any specific provisions set forth by the relevant Third-Party Cloud Storage Provider’s terms of use or privacy policy.&nbsp; OneDrive allows you to go to the following link at any time to revoke OneDrive’s access to your Personal Information:&nbsp; <a href="https://account.live.com/consent/manage">https://account.live.com/consent/manage</a>.</p>
<p><em>dfndr Vault &amp; Google API Services</em></p>
<p>PSafe’s <em>dfndr Vault</em> app allows users to store any file from their mobile device, in a secure, encrypted manner, in the cloud.&nbsp; Versions below 3.3.0 gave the user an option to store these files directly in the user’s own Google Drive account. More recent versions of the app maintain this Google Drive functionality for users who previously had enabled it.&nbsp; When a user enables <em>dfndr Vault</em> to connect to the user’s Google Drive account, all files saved to <em>dfndr Vault</em> are also saved, encrypted, in a folder named “dfndr vault” inside the user’s own Google Drive.&nbsp; <em>Dfndr Vault</em> will only read data from this folder and write data to this folder. To download or to visualize the content of these files (that were saved to the user’s Google Drive), the user must access them from inside the <em>dfndr vault</em> app.</p>
<p><em>PSafe-Provided Cloud Storage </em></p>
<p>As described in the License Agreement, if you use the <em>dfndr vault </em>“Private Cloud” service, PSafe automatically will replicate your files to servers managed by PSafe (located in the United States) but owned by a third party. Files stored in the <em>dfndr vault</em> “Private Cloud” are encrypted and only can be viewed through the <em>dfndr vault</em> application. This automatic replication can be disabled – and replicated files can be deleted from PSafe’s servers – by the user at any time in the <em>dfndr vault</em> settings.</p>
<p><em>Promotions or Contests</em></p>
<p>Winners of any commercial promotions and/or contests conducted by PSafe, or people who participate in PSafe’s loyalty programs, expressly authorize PSafe to share their names, personal data provided to PSafe to participate in the promotion, contest or program, and images (photos), in the ways it sees fit, for the purpose of advertising and/or promotion, without the right to any compensation.</p>
<p><strong>C. SHARING BETWEEN PSAFE COMPANIES; BUSINESS TRANSFERS</strong><br>
We may share and disclose some or all of users’ Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding users’ Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>
<p><a name="VII"></a><br>
<strong>VII. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>YOU CAN STOP ALL COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY OUR APPLICATIONS BY UNINSTALLING THE RELEVANT APPLICATION.</p>
<p>In addition, you have several choices regarding the use of information on our Websites and Services:</p>
<p><strong>A. OPTING OUT</strong><br>
We will communicate with you primarily in the form of emails. You can manage the frequency and/or opt out of receiving these communications by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email. Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you services-related communications including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You also may contact <a href="mailto:support@psafe.com">support@psafe.com</a> to register an “opt-out” request that removes your email from visibility in Identity Theft Report searches, rather than permanently deleting it (to ensure that if the email address appears in information from subsequent Data Breaches obtained by PSafe, it does not become searchable again); note that an email address which is subject to an “opt-out” request may remain searchable if you complete a standard email verification process related to that specific email address.</p>
<p><strong>B. COOKIES</strong><br>
If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from the Websites and/or the Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please consult your browser’s technical information and review the information in Section V.C for more information on how to do so. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Websites and/or the Services or all functionality of the Websites and/or the Services.</p>
<p><strong>C. ACCESSING, UPDATING, CORRECTING OR DELETING INFORMATION</strong><br>
You may review, change, update, or correct your Personal Information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@psafe.com">privacy@psafe.com</a>. You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may request deletion of your Personal information that PSafe has obtained through the date of your request be deleted from our systems, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@psafe.com">privacy@psafe.com</a> and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, but please note that we may be required to keep such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). We may also retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Certain users (e.g., residents of California) have additional rights detailed in <a href="#XI">Section XI</a> below.</p>
<p>Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Services. Please note that even though you may request the deletion of your Personal Information by us, we may be required (by law or otherwise, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time) in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements. When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>
<p><strong>D. CHOOSING NOT TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you may still be able to access and use our Websites and Services; however, you may not be able to access and use those portions of the Websites or Services that require your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Where we need to collect Personal Information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with Services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or Services you requested from us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
<p><strong>E. MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS</strong><br>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain Personal Information uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. You can opt-out of such communications as outlined in Section A, above.</p>
<p>Please note that you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing communications.</p>
<p><a name="VIII"></a><br>
<strong>VIII. DATA SECURITY<br>
</strong>PSafe uses commercially reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.</p>
<p>However, please note that no system can be completely secure and although PSafe will use all reasonable endeavors to protect the integrity of the information you provide, we do not ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p><a name="IX"></a><br>
<strong>IX. NOTIFICATION FOR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT</strong><br>
Should the user verify that any content the user deems to be improper was inserted by a third party in the Websites or Services, the user must send written notice to PSafe indicating the content deemed to be improper, providing sufficient information to enable the specific identification of the alleged improper material, to the e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@PSAFE.COM">privacy@psafe.com</a>.</p>
<p><a name="X"></a><br>
<strong>X. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES</strong><br>
If you are a non-U.S. user of the Websites or Services, by visiting the Websites or using the Services and providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Information will be stored in a database, located in Brazil and/or the United States (via Amazon Web Services) and may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>
<p><a name="XI"></a><strong>XI. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br>

<li>Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>
<li><strong>Opt-out of sales</strong>. If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes .</li>
<li><strong>Opt-in</strong>. If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parent’s or guardian’s permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.</li>
<li><strong>Nondiscrimination</strong>. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to Deletion and Opt-Out requests, note that our applications collect certain data automatically and share it with advertising networks to customize the ads you see within the applications. If you submit such a request, we will cease sharing the data that we have collected to date; however, If you do not uninstall the application(s) after submitting such a request, or if you reinstall the applications(s) in the future, the application(s) will share the data collected during future uses.</p>
<p><strong>How to exercise your rights</strong></p>
<p>You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to information, access and deletion</strong>. You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights by:
<ul>
<li>emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@psafe.com">privacy@psafe.com</a></li>
<li>contacting us via postal mail at the following address:<br>
PSafe Tecnologia S.A.<br>
Caixa Postal 10900<br>
Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana 540, Loja A<br>
AC Copacabana<br>
Copacabana, 22020-970<br>
Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information</strong>. We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money). However, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you. California law classifies our use of these services as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services. This is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads more likely to interest you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can request to opt-out out of this “sale” of your personal information here: <a href="https://www.psafe.com/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>
