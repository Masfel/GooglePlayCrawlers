<li>We perform some of the automatic collection described above through use of cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies which allow us to collect information about the pages and screens you view, the links or ads you click, and other actions you take when using our Services.</li>
<li>Moovit has partnered with a number of selected service providers, whose services and solutions complement, facilitate and enhance our own. These include hosting, database and server co-location services (such as AWS, RedisLabs), data and cyber security services (such as Reblaze), Payment Processors (such as BrainTree, Zooz), fraud detection and prevention services (such as Reblaze), data analytics services (such as Facebook Analytics, Google Analytics), App analytics tools including session replay records for usability and functionality monitoring and analysis (such as: Appsee, Crashlytics), services of measuring our Services attribution and effectivity of our publication and marketing efforts (such as: Appsflyer), e-mail distribution and monitoring services (such as Mailchimp, Mandrill), and our business, legal and financial advisors (collectively, “<strong>Third Party Services</strong>“). Such Third Party Services may receive or otherwise have access to our Users’ personal information, depending on each of their particular roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our Services and business, and may only use it for such purposes. Moovit, as the controller of the information collected from its Users in connection with the use of the Services, remains responsible any personal information processing done by Third Party Services on its behalf, except for events outside of its reasonable control.</li>
<li>Moovit may offer you the option to link Moovit to third party services that may be useful to you, such as ride hailing services. Where Moovit detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service attempts to link to Moovit, or Moovit detects an installed service on the device which has an integration option, or you request a particular integration), Moovit will ask for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts, Moovit will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the accounts and Moovit is not responsible for the third party service’s use of data.
