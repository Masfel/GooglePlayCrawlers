<h2 id="link14"><span style="font-size:20px">14. Security</span></h2>

<pre><strong>We take security seriously and put in place measures to protect your information</strong></pre>

<pre>We have in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data, including:</pre>

<ul>
	<li>In order to protect the unauthorized disclosure of users' personal data from hacking or any external break-ins, we currently use an equipment that blocks any external break-ins, which protects the data from any hacking, attacks, or unauthorized access, and we also use encryption, etc., so that personal data may be transferred safely. In particular, the server containing users' personal data is managed separately so that is not directly linked to the external internet line.</li>
	<li>In preparation for any unexpected emergencies, we have a policy to back-up the system and data. We are taking protective measures to try and minimize damages caused by computer viruses by using vaccines that are regularly updated. Only the minimum number of people have right of access to the users' personal data. We regularly train our staff who handle personal data on new security technology and personal data protection obligations. Further, through an internal designated personal data protection unit, etc., we try and correct any errors immediately upon detection by checking the company's personal data processing procedure implementation and the relevant personnel's compliance with the personal data protection policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="link15"><span style="font-size:20px">15. Where your information is transferred and stored</span></h2>

<pre><strong>We may store, transfer and use your data outside your country.</strong></pre>

<pre>In general, your data will be stored in Japan, the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, where our servers are located. </pre>

<pre>In the event that we transfer your personal data to another country and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfers is undertaken in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please note that where personal data is stored in another country, it may be accessible to law enforcement agencies in accordance with domestic laws.</pre>

<h2 id="link16"><span style="font-size:20px">16. Legal bases for processing your information</span></h2>

<pre><strong>We rely on certain lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you if you are in the EU.</strong></pre>

<pre><u>For users located in the EU only</u>, the GDPR requires us to inform you of the different legal bases that we rely on to legitimize our processing of your personal data. We have described these below.</pre>

<pre><strong>Where you give us your consent to process your personal data</strong></pre>

<pre>We are allowed to use your personal data where you have specifically consented. In order for your consent to be valid: </pre>

<ul>
	<li>It has to be given freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;</li>
	<li>You have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;</li>
	<li>You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid "bundling" consents together so that you don't know exactly what you're agreeing to; and</li>
	<li>You need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – for example, we could provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.</li>
</ul>

<pre>We currently seek your consent for marketing and advertisement purposes.  </pre>

<pre>Before giving your consent you should make sure that you read any accompanying information provided by us so that you understand exactly what you are consenting to.</pre>

<pre>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, and details can be found in the "Right to withdraw consent" paragraph in the link on your rights above.</pre>

<pre><strong>Where processing your information is within our legitimate interests</strong></pre>

<pre>We are allowed to use your personal data where it is in our interests to do so, and those interests aren't outweighed by any potential prejudice to you.</pre>

<pre>We believe that our use of your personal data is within a number of our legitimate interests, including but not limited to:</pre>

<ul>
	<li>To handle customer complaints;</li>
	<li>To verify your identity;</li>
	<li>To ensure that our systems run smoothly;</li>
	<li>To protect against improper use or unauthorized use of our Games; and</li>
	<li>To market our Games.</li>
</ul>

<pre>We don't think that any of the activities set out above will prejudice you in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. We have set out details regarding how you can go about doing this in the link on your rights above.</pre>

<pre><strong>Where processing your personal data is necessary for us to carry out our obligations under our contract with you</strong></pre>

<pre>We are allowed to use your personal data when it is necessary to do so for the performance of our contract with you. For example, we need to process certain personal data about you in order to be able to provide you with the Games and related services (including Games branded websites) which you have requested from us and in order to govern the relationship between you and Smilegate Megaport. </pre>

<pre><strong>Where processing is necessary for us to carry out our legal obligations</strong></pre>

<pre>As well as our obligations to you under any contract, we also have other legal obligations that we need to comply with, and we are allowed to use your personal data when we need to comply with those other legal obligations.</pre>

<pre>This Privacy Policy should come into effect from May. 21, 2020</pre>
