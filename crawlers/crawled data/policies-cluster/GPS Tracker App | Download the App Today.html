It can be set up by an adult or a child. If the app is set up by a child, We first request a parent's code from the “Find My Kids” app. These apps need to be used together. The only personal information we ask for within the “Pingo: Chat with Parents” is the child's age.</p><p>When You as a parent set up the child's “Pingo: Chat with Parents,” Your parental “Find My Kids” app is connected to that child's phone, and You as a parent may create a child's profile within the “Find My Kids” app by providing the following personal information:</p><p>- Child's nickname. This nickname is not displayed publicly.</p><p>- Avatar picture. Only a picture that does not identify the child can be used.

Your child needs to have the “Pingo: Chat With Parents” app installed. Listening and recording are allowed only for the users with the “Find My Kids” app installed and connected with the child's profile. The child is notified that they may be recorded. This information is accessible from the settings of the “Pingo: Chat With Parents” app.</p><p>- Access to the device usage statistics: you as a parent may display the sound regime type on your child’s phone, the child's device's battery level, information regarding the percentage of time spent using other apps.
