General

Simple Gallery is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using Simple Gallery, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

Information being collected

Simple Gallery does not collect any personal identifiable information.

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is used for accessing, editing or removing photos and videos from the users' device.

The `USE_FINGERPRINT` permission is used for locking the app itself, or specific functions.

The `Run At Startup` feature is used at scanning SD card files after a device restart in the background, as the first scan is really slow. So by the time the user launches the app manually, it will be quicker.

Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
