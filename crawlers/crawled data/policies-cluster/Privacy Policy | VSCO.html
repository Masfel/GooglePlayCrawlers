  <h4 id="l1">1. <span>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION</span></h4>
  <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Information you provide us directly —</strong> We ask for certain information such as your name, e-mail address or phone number if you register for an account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). If you purchase products or services or sign up for a subscription, then we may also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in content you post, publish, submit, upload, transmit, or otherwise make available on the Service, such as profile pictures or information, photos, images, music, videos, information, comments, questions, messages, works of authorship and other content or information, as well as associated metadata (“User Content”).  If you sign up for our email mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Information we may receive from third parties —</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the VSCO application, linking your account to the Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to VSCO. This information could include, but is not limited to, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. We may use this information to find your contacts on the Service, to let you know what your contacts are doing on the Service, and to let your contacts know what you are doing on the Service. We may also use it to suggest additional users or friends you may want to follow or connect with. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to VSCO’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Inviting a third party to use our Service —</strong> You have the option to sync your contacts list on your mobile device with the Service so that you can invite your contacts to join the Service via email or text message.  You choose which contacts to invite, and you send the invitations from your own email or text messaging app.  We do not share your contact list with third party marketers or send messages to your contacts directly unless and until they register for the Service.  Your invitees may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database using this <a href="https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/requests/new">form</a>.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Metadata —</strong> We may collect metadata associated with User Content. Metadata typically consists of how, when, where and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content has been formatted. Users can add or may have added metadata added to their User Content including keywords posted with a photo or video, including names, geographical or location information, comments or other data. This makes your data more searchable and more interactive. However, the metadata may be accessible to others if you share the User Content with others or on third party social media sites.
      <br><br>
      We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We may also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

  <blockquote>
      <strong>Use of cookies, software development kits (“SDKs”), and other technology to collect information. </strong> We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
      <strong>Analytics information —</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Cookies information —</strong> When you visit the Service, we and our third party partners may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets VSCO help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. You can find out more about our use of cookies and similar technologies in our <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Software development kits (“SDKs”) –</strong> We use SDKs to incorporate third party computer code into our app, which allows us, and our business partners, service providers and advertising partners to collect data directly from the app for various purposes, including to understand and improve the Service, monitor and provide support for the Service, provide us with analytics regarding the use of the app, enable interaction with social media platforms, add features or functionality to our app, or facilitate online advertising on other websites or services.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Log file information —</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information —</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Device identifiers —</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets) or computer, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by VSCO. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Location data —</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>Ads —</strong> We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on other websites or services. Typically, these third party ad servers or ad networks use cookies and other tracking technology to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service and on other sites around the Web, to send you the ads that, to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. The VSCO Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. For more information about your choices regarding the use of your personal information for online advertising, please see our <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
