<li>We collect your birth date at the initial sign-up screen to verify you have met the age requirement to access our Services.

<li>We may collect certain data you provide on social features of the Services, such as forums or chat. The information you share in these features is publicly viewable by others, which means we may collect and use the information you provide. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation, or based on our legitimate interest in doing so (ensuring the safety of our Services).</li>
<li>When you play multiplayer games, some information may be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We engage in these activities based on our legitimate interest in doing so (increasing engagement with our games and Services).</li>

Such information includes details of your visits to the Services and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time you accessed or left the Site or App, and which pages you viewed.

<li>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing the Services by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in the server log files whenever you visit the Services, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Services, browser type and operating system, device information, device event information, and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Site. We and our Service Providers use IP addresses for our internal business purposes such as calculating Site and App usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Services, and determining your approximate geographic location.</li>
<li>We use your IP address to determine your general geographical location, such as the country or region from which your mobile device accesses our Service.

<p><strong>3 – Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. “Process Cookies” are cookies that help our Sites to function properly and assist in navigating pages and accessing Services. Without these cookies, the Sites may not function properly. “Session State Cookies” are cookies that collect information about how you interact with our Sites. This may include the page you visit most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies help improve your browsing experience, but blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the Sites unusable. When you visit a Site again, the cookie allows that Site to recognize your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however, that some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email.&nbsp; We use pixel tags to track activity on our Sites, and to determine when our emails are opened or accessed.&nbsp; We use pixel tags in combination with cookies.</p>
<p>The Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit the Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Sites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on the Sites, the social media plug-in allows that social media website to receive information that you have visited the Sites. The social media plug-in also allows the social media website to share information about your activities on the Sites with other users of their social media website. These sharing settings are managed by the social media website and governed by its privacy policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each of these websites, apps, or services before connecting your accounts or sharing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to sites and online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To learn more about cookies and any “Do Not Track” features, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ and http://www.allaboutdnt.com. If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Sites may not be available to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a procedure on most devices through which the Sites are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies.</p>
<p>If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Sites, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Sites. We expect Service Providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but cannot guarantee that they will do so.</p>

<p>We do not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) (“Children’s Personal Information”) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA, and for any children’s or mixed-use portions of our site (if any) we will comply with COPPA. &nbsp;If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us at&nbsp;the address listed below (Attention: Legal)&nbsp;and we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA. &nbsp;Parents may want to consider commercially available parental control protections to limit what minors can access online and/or monitor their minor children’s online activities. Examples include:</p>
<p>If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their child’s personal information, they should contact us to request the deletion of the information:</p>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).&nbsp; Given the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Information</strong></p>
<p>For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.&nbsp; Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.&nbsp; If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).&nbsp; The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others</strong></p>
<p>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our websites or third parties.</p>

If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by emailing us at&nbsp;privacypolicy@d3go.com.&nbsp; Please note that any information, including personally identifiable information that you reveal in a bulletin board, message board, chat room or other public forum is publicly viewable on the site.</p>
<p>Removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers. We are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g. other users) who may have copied or reposted this information.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes or otherwise, unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>2 – Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may collect and use certain information about you.&nbsp; “Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you (whether alone or in combination) such as your first and last name, email address, zip code/post code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, age, date of birth, and social media handles.&nbsp; More specifically, when you use the Services, we may collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect certain information that you provide directly to us by filling in forms on the Services, including your name or username, password, email address, street address, telephone number, social media handles, user-uploaded photographs or profile pictures, or other information, when you create an account or profile, interact with other users, or create a customer support ticket request. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, and where relevant, to comply with a legal obligation or based on our legitimate interest in doing so.</li>
<li>We collect your birth date at the initial sign-up screen to verify you have met the age requirement to access our Services. We engage in these activities to comply with legal obligations and based on our legitimate interest in doing so (such as to ensure children below the age of legal capacity cannot access Services).</li>
<li>We may collect certain data you provide on social features of the Services, such as forums or chat. The information you share in these features is publicly viewable by others, which means we may collect and use the information you provide. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation, or based on our legitimate interest in doing so (ensuring the safety of our Services).</li>
<li>When you play multiplayer games, some information may be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We engage in these activities based on our legitimate interest in doing so (increasing engagement with our games and Services).</li>
<li>We may collect certain information that you provide to us when making a purchase via our Services, including your name, billing address, telephone number, payment method, and other payment details in order to process purchases you make. We do so to adhere to our contractual relationship with you or for our legitimate interest.</li>

Such information includes details of your visits to the Services and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time you accessed or left the Site or App, and which pages you viewed. Some parts of the Services use cookies, pixel tags (also known as “web beacons”), and other technologies to collect this information about your general internet usage.&nbsp; See our “Cookie Policy” to learn more.</li>
<li>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing the Services by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in the server log files whenever you visit the Services, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Services, browser type and operating system, device information, device event information, and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Site. We and our Service Providers use IP addresses for our internal business purposes such as calculating Site and App usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Services, and determining your approximate geographic location.</li>
<li>We use your IP address to determine your general geographical location, such as the country or region from which your mobile device accesses our Service. We and our Service Providers may use your device’s general location to provide you with personalized location-based services, content and advertisements. We do this to support our legitimate interests.</li>

See below regarding Your Choices.</li>

In the event of a conflict between such rules and this Privacy Policy, such rules will govern.</li>
<li>In some cases, we aggregate or anonymize your personal information so that it is not identifiable to you.&nbsp; We may use this information for our business purposes, such as analyzing and better understanding usage trends.</li>

<p>A “cookie” is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. “Process Cookies” are cookies that help our Sites to function properly and assist in navigating pages and accessing Services. Without these cookies, the Sites may not function properly. “Session State Cookies” are cookies that collect information about how you interact with our Sites. This may include the page you visit most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies help improve your browsing experience, but blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the Sites unusable. When you visit a Site again, the cookie allows that Site to recognize your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however, that some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email.&nbsp; We use pixel tags to track activity on our Sites, and to determine when our emails are opened or accessed.&nbsp; We use pixel tags in combination with cookies.</p>
<p>The Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit the Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Sites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on the Sites, the social media plug-in allows that social media website to receive information that you have visited the Sites. The social media plug-in also allows the social media website to share information about your activities on the Sites with other users of their social media website. These sharing settings are managed by the social media website and governed by its privacy policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each of these websites, apps, or services before connecting your accounts or sharing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to sites and online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To learn more about cookies and any “Do Not Track” features, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ and http://www.allaboutdnt.com. If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Sites may not be available to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a procedure on most devices through which the Sites are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies.</p>
<p>If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Sites, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Sites. We expect Service Providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but cannot guarantee that they will do so.</p>

<p>Last updated&nbsp;<strong>January 22, 2019</strong></p>
<p>D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC.</p>
<p><strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS “EULA”), WHICH IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, THE END USER (“YOU”), AND D3PUBLISHER OF AMERICA, INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE MARVEL PUZZLE QUEST: DARK REIGN MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p>Terms of Use. &nbsp;The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p>Scope of License. &nbsp;This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property. &nbsp;All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws. The Game may include registered and unregistered trademarks owned by or licensed to D3PA, which may not be copied, imitated or used, without the prior written permission of D3PA.</p>
<p>Charges. &nbsp;If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges.

AND ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, “D3PA”, “WE” OR “US”), CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE MAGIC: THE GATHERING – PUZZLE QUEST MOBILE GAME PROVIDED BY D3PA (THE “GAME”). BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE GAME, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, PLEASE DO NOT CLICK “ACCEPT” OR OTHERWISE DOWNLOAD OR USE THE GAME.</p>
<p>Terms of Use.&nbsp; The Game is licensed, not sold, to you by D3PA. By using the Game, you agree to be bound by this EULA. We reserve all rights in and to the Game not expressly granted to you under this EULA. We may modify this EULA, at our sole discretion, without your consent, effective immediately upon posting of the revised EULA, and you agree to and accept this condition. The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available. You are responsible for checking this EULA each time before using the Game. Continued use of the Game following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the updated EULA.</p>
<p>Scope of License.&nbsp; This EULA is a non-exclusive, limited, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, terminable license to use the Game on mobile devices that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules of the Mobile Platform Operator, or other terms and conditions applying to your mobile device. This EULA does not allow you to use the Game on any device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the terms and conditions relating to your device, you may not distribute or make the Game available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Game and, if you sell your device to a third party, you must remove the Game before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this EULA and the terms and conditions for your mobile device), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Game or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any forgoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-source components included with the Game). Any attempt to do so is violation of the rights of D3PA and D3PA’s licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property.&nbsp; All content included in the Game, including text, design, graphics, logos, user interfaces, button icons, images, photographs, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations and software (but not including any content posted by users) is owned by D3PA or D3PA’s licensors and protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws.

<p>Charges.&nbsp; If there is a charge associated with the Game, you agree to pay that charge. If the Game is free, there may still be charges for additional content within the Game, including virtual currency and virtual goods (both defined below), and you agree to pay those charges. You may be able to prevent purchase of such additional content by adjusting your mobile device’s settings. Certain devices may keep you logged on for a period of time after you download the Game (or after you make a purchase through the Game). This may allow a user (for example, a child) to incur charges without entering your password. This is a function of the software of these devices and not within our control. Prices for the Game exclude all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You may still incur charges incidental to using the Game even if the Game itself is free (for example, charges for internet access, text messaging, and other data transmission). You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes or other charges related to your use of the Game. Any amounts paid for the Game or virtual items or virtual currency are non-refundable, except as expressly set forth in this EULA. You understand that all purchases and charges made by you are final. You are not entitled to any refund or return for products sold for any reason. Any election to honor a refund or return shall be made at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>Consent to Use of Data.&nbsp; We may ask you to submit certain personal information in order to register a D3PA account.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixpanel is a program we use to review user habits and game analytics using user_ID, username, advertising identifiers, and IP address.

<ul>
<li>Appsflyer – Advertising ID, such as IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) and Google Advertiser ID, and IP Address are shared with Appsflyer in order to attribute installs of the game to advertisements.

The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.

If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern.

If the price is incorrect, regardless of whether it is an error in a price posted on the Services or otherwise communicated to you, then we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to cancel your order and refund to you the amount that you paid, regardless of how the error occurred. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in these Terms, payment may be taken in full notwithstanding any claim for short delivery or defects.</p>

The terms of this EULA will govern any upgrades provided by D3PA that replace and/or supplement the original Game, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. You acknowledge that this EULA is concluded solely between you and D3PA, and not with the provider of your device and/or mobile platform operator (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon) (collectively, the “Mobile Platform Operator”), and that D3PA is solely responsible for the Game and the content thereof, except as otherwise provided in this EULA. If this EULA is less restrictive than, or in conflict with, the terms or conditions of service imposed by any applicable Mobile Platform Operator, the terms and conditions of the Mobile Platform Operator will govern. Material changes to this EULA will be announced by posting them in the Mobile Platform Operator’s commerce center or store (e.g., Apple App Store, Android Market) where the Game may be available.
