<p><strong>Pricing and Payments</strong></p>
<p>All prices, discounts and descriptions made available on the Services are subject to availability, and may be withdrawn or revised at any time. While we try to be as accurate as possible in the descriptions regarding the products and Services, there may be errors in the information displayed to you. Prices may be indicated on the Services or an order acknowledgement, but the authoritative price in the event of any discrepancy, is the price in effect at the time of acceptance through the charge placed through your selected payment method. Payment shall be made by the payment method selected during your order completion process. We will charge credit or debit cards on dispatch or commencement of the product or Service. We reserve the right to verify and/or authorize credit or debit card payments prior to acceptance. For that reason, we reserve the right to notify you of any errors in product or Service descriptions or in the price prior to the dispatch. If the price is incorrect, regardless of whether it is an error in a price posted on the Services or otherwise communicated to you, then we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to cancel your order and refund to you the amount that you paid, regardless of how the error occurred. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in these Terms, payment may be taken in full notwithstanding any claim for short delivery or defects.</p>
<p>We offer various payment methods on our Services, some of which are managed by third-party payment and billing providers for which additional terms and costs may apply. Please review such additional terms and costs carefully. You may also be required to create an account with such third-party provider. You agree that we may, at our sole discretion and without further notice, determine and change the availability of certain payment solutions, from time to time without any liability to you. We reserve the right to suspend and/or revoke your account and/or to restrict you from placing orders in the Services and/or to restrict you from using certain payment methods, if we reasonably suspect that you have undertaken (or are attempting/have attempted to undertake) a fraudulent transaction.</p>
<p>Unauthorized “chargebacks” (unwarranted or illegitimate refunds) violate these Terms, and players who engage in the practice will have their accounts removed from the game. Additional steps may also be taken at our discretion.</p>

<p><strong>2 – Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may collect and use certain information about you.&nbsp; “Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you (whether alone or in combination) such as your first and last name, email address, zip code/post code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, age, date of birth, and social media handles.&nbsp; More specifically, when you use the Services, we may collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect certain information that you provide directly to us by filling in forms on the Services, including your name or username, password, email address, street address, telephone number, social media handles, user-uploaded photographs or profile pictures, or other information, when you create an account or profile, interact with other users, or create a customer support ticket request. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, and where relevant, to comply with a legal obligation or based on our legitimate interest in doing so.</li>
<li>We collect your birth date at the initial sign-up screen to verify you have met the age requirement to access our Services. We engage in these activities to comply with legal obligations and based on our legitimate interest in doing so (such as to ensure children below the age of legal capacity cannot access Services).</li>
<li>We may collect certain data you provide on social features of the Services, such as forums or chat. The information you share in these features is publicly viewable by others, which means we may collect and use the information you provide. We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation, or based on our legitimate interest in doing so (ensuring the safety of our Services).</li>
<li>When you play multiplayer games, some information may be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We engage in these activities based on our legitimate interest in doing so (increasing engagement with our games and Services).</li>

Such information includes details of your visits to the Services and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time you accessed or left the Site or App, and which pages you viewed. Some parts of the Services use cookies, pixel tags (also known as “web beacons”), and other technologies to collect this information about your general internet usage.&nbsp; See our “Cookie Policy” to learn more.</li>
<li>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing the Services by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in the server log files whenever you visit the Services, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Services, browser type and operating system, device information, device event information, and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Site. We and our Service Providers use IP addresses for our internal business purposes such as calculating Site and App usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Services, and determining your approximate geographic location.</li>
<li>We use your IP address to determine your general geographical location, such as the country or region from which your mobile device accesses our Service. We and our Service Providers may use your device’s general location to provide you with personalized location-based services, content and advertisements. We do this to support our legitimate interests.</li>

In the event of a conflict between such rules and this Privacy Policy, such rules will govern.</li>
<li>In some cases, we aggregate or anonymize your personal information so that it is not identifiable to you.&nbsp; We may use this information for our business purposes, such as analyzing and better understanding usage trends.</li>

<p><strong>3 – Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. “Process Cookies” are cookies that help our Sites to function properly and assist in navigating pages and accessing Services. Without these cookies, the Sites may not function properly. “Session State Cookies” are cookies that collect information about how you interact with our Sites. This may include the page you visit most often and whether you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies help improve your browsing experience, but blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the Sites unusable. When you visit a Site again, the cookie allows that Site to recognize your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however, that some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email.&nbsp; We use pixel tags to track activity on our Sites, and to determine when our emails are opened or accessed.&nbsp; We use pixel tags in combination with cookies.</p>
<p>The Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit the Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Sites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on the Sites, the social media plug-in allows that social media website to receive information that you have visited the Sites. The social media plug-in also allows the social media website to share information about your activities on the Sites with other users of their social media website. These sharing settings are managed by the social media website and governed by its privacy policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of each of these websites, apps, or services before connecting your accounts or sharing any Personal Information.</p>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to sites and online services you visit.
