Some of our websites and mobile apps are for adults as well as children. If you are an adult, you should take a look at our general audience <a href="http://www.warnerbros.com/privacy-center-wb-privacy-policy">Warner Bros. Privacy Policy</a> (https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/)&nbsp;for more information about how we will collect and use your data, including on Services that link to &nbsp;this policy.</p> <p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p> <p><strong>- WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?&nbsp;<br> - HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?&nbsp;</strong><br> <strong>- HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?&nbsp;<br> - COOKIES<br> - SENDING YOUR INFORMATION AROUND THE WORLD<br> - WE WANT TO KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE&nbsp;<br> - YOUR RIGHTS<br> - CONTACT US<br> - UPDATES<br> -&nbsp;CALIFORNIA AND CCPA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES<br> -&nbsp;CALIFORNIA INFORMATION WE COLLECTED AND SHARED<br> -&nbsp;YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS TO REQUEST DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND SHARE ABOUT YOU<br> -&nbsp;YOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST THE DELETION OF CALIFORNIA INFORMATION<br> - HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS<br> - OUR SUPPORT FOR THE EXERCISE YOUR DATA RIGHTS<br> - CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS UNDER 16 YEARS OLD<br> - CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS UNDER 18 YEARS OLD<br> - BRAZIL - PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p> <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</strong></p> <p><strong>Information about you</strong></p> <p>For some of our Services, you don’t need to give us information like your name or email address to use the Service. &nbsp;</p> <p>For some of our Services, we will ask for some more information from you so you can use the Service. We might need to ask permission from the adult who looks after you before you can give us this information. &nbsp;This can include things like:&nbsp;</p> <p>- your first name<br> - your location&nbsp;<br> - your email address<br> - your username&nbsp;<br> - your telephone number<br> - your home address<br> - numbers that identify your account or device<br> - a photo or video of you</p> <p>For some of our Services, such as virtual worlds, you can play games, talk with your friends or get items, such as gems and additional costumes or powers for your character. For these Services you need to choose a nickname or create an account. You will need to create a username and password and fill out other information about you. &nbsp;For some Services, we collect your email address to help you make an account and then we keep your email address only in a “hashed” format so that it doesn’t identify you. &nbsp;We use these “hashed” email addresses to help with your account, like to help you if you forget your password. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Information about your adult</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, we need to collect information about the adult who looks after you. For example, we do this so we can:</p> <p>- let them know about your interest in the Services<br> - ask them for permission so you can access parts of our Services<br> -&nbsp;tell them how to start some of the features for you</p> <p>When we need to contact the adult who looks after you, we will need to get some information from them, so we may ask for their:&nbsp;</p> <p>- full name&nbsp;<br> -&nbsp;address<br> - email address<br> -&nbsp;telephone number</p> <p><strong>When you buy things</strong></p> <p>Before buying something, you should always have permission from the adult who looks after you. When you buy something in a Service, your adult may have to pay for it with real money. Some of our Services allow you to buy things inside the Service, pay to join our clubs, and use online money from our Services.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>When you talk with your friends</strong></p> <p>Some of our Services will let you talk with your friends in a way that shows your conversation with other people on the Service. Usually, you will choose from phrases we have already written. Otherwise, we will look at the messages so no one uses any bad words or shares your personal information. If we see that you are sharing your personal information with someone else, we will try to delete it before it is shared. We may ask permission from the adult who looks after you before we let you talk to your friends on our Services or if our Services let you post on social media.</p> <p><strong>Information about your computer, console or smartphone</strong></p> <p>When you visit or use one of our Services, we will get some information about your device and your internet browser (for example, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about your IP Address and how you use our Services. To learn more, see our section about Cookies.</p> <p><strong>Notifications</strong></p> <p>Our apps may send you alerts from inside the app on your device to help you use the app. For some of our apps, you can also choose to receive notifications on your device that are sent from outside your device (called push notifications). We may need to ask permission from the adult who looks after you to collect the information that we need to send you these push notifications. You can always turn push notifications off in the settings of your device. This might be difficult, so make sure to ask the adult who looks after you to help.</p> <p><strong>When you contact us</strong></p> <p>If you contact us by email or using an online form, we will ask you for some information. For example, this may include your first name and email address. We will also ask you to tell us why you are contacting us. Once we have helped you, we will delete your information.</p> <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>We use your information for different reasons.</p> <p><strong>Where we enter into a contract with you or your parent or guardian</strong></p> <p>For us to provide our services in accordance with their terms of use, we need to use some of your information:</p> <p>- to let you know if those terms or our policies are changing<br> -&nbsp;to give you access to our services, or other things you can receive or connect to through our services<br> -&nbsp;to register you for games or competitions and make sure their rules are followed<br> -&nbsp;to handle purchases and other things you or your parent or guardian order and any related messages about those</p> <p>If you don't provide the necessary information, we will not be able to do these things for you.</p> <p><strong>Where we have a legitimate interest&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When using your information is very important to us but still fair to you, we have something called a "legitimate interest". When we have a legitimate interest and we use your information, we need to be sure that it is not going to upset you. We will use your information for our legitimate interest only if the laws of your country allow this. &nbsp;In some countries, we may need to ask for your consent or the consent of the adult who looks after you before we can use your information in these ways.</p> <p>For example, we have a legitimate interest when we give you access:</p> <p>- to our Services<br> - to play games<br> -&nbsp;to chat with your friends<br> -&nbsp;to post or send us comments</p> <p>We also have a legitimate interest, so we can:</p> <p>- learn how we can make our Services better<br> -&nbsp;make sure your experience can be special and personalized for you<br> -&nbsp;keep you and others safe<br> -&nbsp;answer your questions and comments when you contact us</p> <p><strong>If you and/or the adult who looks after you gives us permission (consent)</strong></p> <p>If you are old enough, you can give us permission to use your information. If you are not old enough, you will sometimes need to ask the adult who looks after you for permission. For example, when you want to receive a newsletter.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>If the law says we must use your information</strong></p> <p>If the law says we must use your information, then we will do so. For example:</p> <p>- if the government or the police need to investigate something<br> -&nbsp;if the law says we need to use your information</p> <p><strong>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p> <p><strong>Our helpers (service providers)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we have helpers who make sure our Services are great. They will help operate the Services or help with buying things on our Services, like points. They will also help with sending prizes to competition winners. We make sure that our helpers keep your information safe.</p> <p><strong>Our friends (for example, co-sponsors)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we ask our friends to help us with our Services. If we do, they will have access to your information. We will let you know when we ask our friends to help us.</p> <p><strong>Our family (affiliates)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we may share information with members of our family that agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. You can find a list of some of the Warner Bros. Entertainment Group companies and affiliated WarnerMedia companies by visiting our <a href="https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/en-us/affiliates">affiliates’ page</a> (https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/en-us/affiliates/html/affiliates_en-us_2.4.0.html). We may update this list from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Links to other people's websites (external links)</strong></p> <p>Our Services will sometimes have links to other people's websites. Those people can treat your information differently from us. You should make sure you understand how they will use your information by looking at their privacy policies.</p> <p><strong>Sharing information&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When we have your adult’s permission for you to use social media platforms or plugins on our Services, those platforms can share their information back to the social media platform. This can mean that your friends will be told about what you do on our Service. You and the adult who looks after you should look at the privacy policies of these social media sites to learn more about how they use information about you.</p> <p><strong>If the law says we must share your information</strong></p> <p>Warner Bros., our friends and our helpers will sometimes need to share your information with other people when the law says so. For example, this can happen if the police, a judge, or the government asks us to. We need to share your information if it will help us stop people from doing bad things or committing crimes. We also need to share your information if it will help us protect you or other people.</p> <p><strong>If we sell or reorganize our business</strong></p> <p>If we sell or reorganize our business, we will share your information with the buyer or entity taking over operation of the Service.</p> <p><strong>If you or the adult who looks after you gives us permission</strong></p> <p>If you or the adult who looks after you gives us permission to share your information for something, then we will share your information in the way we describe at the time.</p> <p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p> <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p> <p>Cookies are tiny files that have information (data) in them. Sometimes we use other types of digital technologies, but they work a lot like cookies. When you visit our Services, a cookie is placed on your device (like your computer, console or smartphone). Some mobile apps have technology that works like cookies. Cookies do not hurt your device.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What do cookies do?</strong></p> <p>Cookies help us to make your experience better. They can remember what you do on the Service (like your high score) and help us understand what you like doing. &nbsp;The cookies will also help us know which parts of the Services are popular and which ones we need to make better.<br> Some of our helpers and friends use their own cookies or other technology to help us or for their own activities. For example, these can help us understand how many people visited a Service.</p> <p><strong>Turning cookies off</strong></p> <p>You can choose to turn cookies off. You can also choose to block all cookies. You can do this using the settings menu. This might be difficult so make sure to ask the adult who looks after you to help you.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you do choose to turn cookies off, somethings on the website or Service might not work properly or your experience might not be as good.</p> <p>Some of our Services use a helper called Google Analytics. You have to turn off their cookies in a different way. To learn how to turn off their cookies, by visiting the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage">Google Analytics Cookie Usage Website</a> [https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage]. You can also get the adult who looks after you to install a plug-in so they can take control of Google Analytics cookies. They can do this by visiting the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google tool website</a> at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en].</p> <p><strong>SENDING YOUR INFORMATION AROUND THE WORLD</strong></p> <p>We have offices around the world. Sometimes, we will need to send your information to a different country. Usually, this is to the United States where Warner Bros. and our helpers will use your information in the way we have already described in this Privacy Policy. It is important to remember that some countries do not have laws that protect your information in the same way. If you or the adult who looks after you want more information about how we send your information around the world, you can contact us by using the information at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>WE WANT TO KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE</strong></p> <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information to stop other people getting to it. We also make sure to not keep your information for too long. If we need your information for our own purposes, we will also keep your information for three years after you last contact our customer support team or interact with our websites and apps or after you stop being subscribed or registered with us. Sometimes the law says we have to keep your information for longer than this. We may have to keep your information for longer to protect you and us. &nbsp;When it’s time for us to stop keeping your information, we will burn or shred hard copies (like print-outs) and delete electronic copies in a way that means no one can read that information.</p> <p>We may need to send you a message if someone gets to your information without our permission. &nbsp;We will usually send this message by email to you or the adult who takes care of you. &nbsp;Our message will explain what happened, why this matters to you, and what we are doing to fix it. &nbsp;If we cannot send you this message directly, we may make a public post about it.</p> <p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p> <p>You or the adult who looks after you can ask to access your information, ask us to delete it, or stop us from using it sometimes. Sometimes they can even ask us to fix any mistakes or send it to someone else. Where we have asked the adult who looks after you to agree to let us use your information, they can stop us from using it. You or your adult can make these requests through our online portal by visiting our <a href="https://privacycenter.wb.com/">Privacy Center</a>.

You acknowledge and agree that Warner will have no liability for the use or loss of Virtual Items for any reason, including due to any unauthorized third-party activity, such as hacking, phishing, password mining, social engineering, or any other unauthorized activity.

YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE—THAT IS, GIVE UP—THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY THAT IS NOT FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AND ANY RIGHT YOU OR WE MAY HAVE HAD TO PURSUE THAT DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY IN ANY FORUM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p> <h2><strong>15. Indemnity</strong></h2> <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Warner and its directors, officers, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, agents, and licensors (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorney fees and costs, resulting from: (i) your breach of any of the representations, warranties, and agreements made hereunder; (ii) your use of the Service; (iii) your placement or transmission of any User Content onto the Service; (iv) any use of your Account in violation of this Agreement or your failure to fulfill any obligations incurred through the use of your Account by you or a third party; or (v) your willful misconduct.</p> <h2><strong>16. Dispute Resolution</strong></h2> <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p> <p>Our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction. Please contact us via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@wb.com?subject=Informal%20Resolution">legal@wb.com</a>&nbsp;so that we may attempt to resolve the dispute informally.&nbsp;<strong>In the unlikely event that you're not satisfied with customer service's solution (or if Warner has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction</strong>.</p> <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this Dispute Resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp;<strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted</strong>. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p> <p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator’s award if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute.</p> <h4><strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</strong></h4> <p>A<strong>.<em> Claims Subject to Arbitration:&nbsp;</em></strong>Warner and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</li> <li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li> <li>claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;</li> <li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li> <li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li> </ul> <p>References to “Warner,” “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns (including AT&amp;T and its affiliates); and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Service under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp;<strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action</strong>. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p> <p>B. <em><strong>Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes:&nbsp;</strong></em>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Warner should be sent by certified mail to: General Counsel, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 4000 Warner Blvd., Burbank, CA 91522(“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).</p> <p>If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled. You may download a form to initiate arbitration at:&nbsp;<a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf">adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf</a></p> <p>C. <em><strong>Arbitration Procedure:&nbsp;</strong></em>The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the AAA. (If the AAA is unavailable, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as provided in subsection (F) below, the arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law.</p> <p>D. <em><strong>Arbitration Fees:&nbsp;</strong></em>After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000 in value. (The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75,000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p> <p>E. <em><strong>Alternative Payment:&nbsp;</strong></em>If you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (B) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (“the alternative payment”), whichever is greater.</p> <p>If we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you will be entitled to receive the alternative payment if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. In assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.</p> <p>Although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award.</p> <p>F.&nbsp;<strong><em>Requirement of Individual Arbitration</em></strong>: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.&nbsp;<strong>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING</strong>. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or request for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p> <p>G.&nbsp;<strong><em>Future Changes to Arbitration Provision</em></strong>: Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) following your use of this Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p> <h2><strong>17.
