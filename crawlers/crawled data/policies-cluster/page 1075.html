<p>
    Based on your consent you provided for ”Profiling”, we create user segments and use these user segments for
    <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="To learn more about our user acquisition and remarketing activities, see the section below." aria-expanded="false">
        new user acquisition and remarketing purposes
    </span>.
    The user segments are created based on your in-game behaviour (such as your in-game purchases, your sharing
    activity, and the level you have reached within the game) and by determining the spending behaviour for each
    segment. For this purpose, your Personal Data, including your in-game behaviour, your country, game language,

<h4>
    New user acquisition, remarketing and campaign tracking
</h4>
<p>
    The following processes help us to find new users, remarket existing users and measure the effectiveness of our
    advertisements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>New user acquisition:</strong> In order to acquire new users, we create advertisements
            (banners/videos) for Governor of Poker 3 and provide our advertisements to third-party user acquisition
            companies which show our ads in their apps or on their websites. If you click on the banner/video shown to
            you in a third-party app or on a third-party website, you will be redirected to the app stores (Google,
            Steam or Apple) where you can install Governor of Poker 3. The information that you have clicked/viewed the
            advertisement (campaign information) will be sent from the user acquisition companies to an attribution
            platform provider (Appsflyer) and will then be passed by Appsflyer to the app store. If you install Governor
            of Poker 3, the campaign information will also be passed from the app store to us and will be processed
            <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="For more information, see the ”Campaign tracking” section below." aria-expanded="false">
                to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements
            </span>.
            The described data processing activities help us prevent fraud, to track and optimize our campaigns, and to
            reward our user acquisition partners. This is based on our legitimate interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you start playing Governor of Poker 3, we collect and share post install events (for example, the level
            you reached within the game and purchase segments) either through the Appsflyer SDK or directly with the
            user acquisition companies which helps them optimizing their services. We share these post install events
            based on our legitimate interest.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, we use
            <span class="tooltip" data-tippy-content="Learn more about Facebook’s ”Lookalike Audience” feature <a href=https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328 target=_blank>here</a>." aria-expanded="false">

                user segments
            </span>
            we have created for our user base. In order to allow Facebook to search for a ”lookalike audience”, we
            select the segments that have a good spending behaviour and give a list of these users' Facebook IDs and
            Advertisement IDs (IDFA from the device, which users can reset) to Facebook. Facebook processes this
            information to check the Facebook profiles of the respective users for common characteristics of these users
            (for example, hobbies or the user’s location, using data available only to Facebook and which is not shared
            with us) and to find similar new users ('lookalikes') which are likely to be interested in our game. These
            similar users will be shown advertisements (banners/videos) for Governor of Poker 3 to encourage them to
            click the advertisements and install Governor of Poker 3 through the app-store.
        </p>
    </li>

        user ID, your country and language with third-party user acquisition companies. Furthermore, we will share

        through the Appsflyer SDK or directly with the user acquisition companies to help them optimizing their
        campaigns.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Campaign validation and fraud prevention:</strong> In order to prevent fraud and analyze our
            campaigns we send campaign data we receive from our user acquisition partners in connection with the
            acquisition of new users (views, clicks and installs, campaign ID) together with
