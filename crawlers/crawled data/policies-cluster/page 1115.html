    <span class="t2">Google</span>
<span class="t3">Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en
<br>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.
</span>
<span class="t3">Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.</span>
<span class="t3">We have implemented the following:</span>
    <ul><li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li></ul>
<span class="t3">We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</span>
<span class="t2">Opting out:</span>
<span class="t3">Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</span>
<span class="t2">California Online Privacy Protection Act</span>
<span class="t3">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span>
<span class="t3">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
<br>Users can visit our site anonymously.
<br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
<br>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
</span>
<span class="t3">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</span>
    <ul><li> On our Privacy Policy Page</li></ul>

<span class="t3">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br>
It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking
</span>
<span class="t2">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</span>
<span class="t3">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</span>
<span class="t2">Fair Information Practices</span>
    <span class="t3">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br>We will notify you via email<ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul>We will notify the users via in-site notification<ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul></span>
<span class="t3">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</span>
<span class="t2">CAN SPAM Act</span>
<span class="t3">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</span>
<span class="t3">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
      <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
      <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
      <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
      <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
    </ul>

for technical reasons (such as technical difficulties experienced by us or on the internet);
to allow us to improve user experience;
where we have legal reasons for doing so (including privacy or other legal objections to the content or conduct of our Services);
because it no longer makes business sense for us to provide the relevant Game or part of our Services; or

<br>2.5 There may also be times when our Services or any part of our Services is not available for technical or maintenance related reasons, whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis.
</span>
<span class="t2">3.Accounts</span>
<span class="t3">3.1 You agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret.

In these terms, references to "log in details" or "account" include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Services to interact with.

<br>3.2 If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.

<br>3.3 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorized person accessing your account and using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorized use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.

You agree that Virtual Money and Virtual Goods can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else. You also agree that you will only obtain Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods from us, and not from any third party.

<br>4.2 You do not own Virtual Goods or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them – any balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.

<br>4.3 You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made.
<br>4.4 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.
