                                The moment you start navigating our website, your computer provides us with your IP address and, depending on what you do and what your computer settings are, we start storing small text files on your hard drive ("cookies"). These files help us improve your user experience on our website. It's a kind of short-term memory of your browser.

                                Text files ("log files") are also created in our system. They may contain the following information about you: the model of your computer and the type of its operating system, your browser type and version, the URL of the web page you are coming from, and the time. Log files can not be assigned to specific persons. We do not try to link this data to cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to retrospectively evaluate log files in individual cases if we become aware of concrete indications for their unlawful use. Log files help us understand what types of computers our website should support and when a lot of (or few) people use it. Based on this information, we can adjust our web pages structure, servers, and database systems to better meet the needs of our customers.

                                <br><br>
                                We currently use social media plug-ins provided by Facebook and Twitter. When you visit our website, no personal data is passed on to these providers. You can easily recognize a provider by its logo on the respective button and interact directly with it via that button. The moment you click the button, the plug-in provider starts receiving the information about the website you came from. By activating the plug-in, you give its provider access to your personal data (for plug-in providers in the USA) (in the case of Facebook in Germany, IP addresses are anonymized immediately after data collection). Since plug-in providers collect data mainly via cookies, we recommend that you delete all the cookies in the security settings of your browser.
                                <br><br>
                                We have no influence on data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, purpose of processing, and retention periods. We also cannot delete the data collected by a plug-in provider.
                                <br><br>
                                A plug-in provider stores the data gathered about you as user profiles and utilizes them for the purposes of advertising, market research, and/or tailor-made website design. That is done (also for non-logged in users) to provide needs-based advertising and to you inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the user profiles information being used by contacting a plug-in provider.
                                <br><br>
                                We, from our side, use plug-ins to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offers to make them more interesting for you as our customer. Article 6 (1) (f) of the DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the use of plug-ins.
                                <br><br>
                                Your personal data transfer takes place depending on whether you have an account with a plug-in provider and are logged in there or not. If you are logged in, the data collected while you have been using our website will be assigned to your existing plug-in account. If you click the plug-in button and, for example, link to the provider’s page, this information will be stored in your user account and shared with your contacts publicly. That’s why we recommend that you log out the social network regularly, especially after using the plug-in, as this will prevent your personal data from being transferred to the plug-in provider.
                                <br><br>
                                Below you could find privacy statements of the Facebook and Twitter plug-in providers, including their addresses and privacy notices URLs, explaining in detail how they collect and process data. Moreover, you’ll get information on your rights and privacy protection settings options.

For more details on Facebook plug-ins, please follow the link: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.

We use this technical data to fully investigate the problems you report in order to reproduce and solve them as soon as possible. We reserve the right to ask for further details should we need more information. We can do that by sending requests to your email address.

Thanks to them, we get a more comprehensive idea of what is going on and at the same time obtain the object for testing. We keep this data for some time to have it accessible in case you inform us that the same issues start reproducing again. We would like to assure you that the multimedia you provide for that purpose is used only by those team members who are responsible for reproducing and solving the problems and is stored temporarily.

                                The moment you allow our apps to access your photo albums, you allow them to access the EXIF data attached to your photos. Moreover, if the Location Services option is turned on on your device, you automatically make it possible for the apps to determine and track the precise real-time location of the device you are using. Though accessible, this personal data is neither used nor shared.

                                When processing your data, we use some programs and services provided by other companies ("tools"). We change the tools from time to time if that makes sense for legal, technical, or economic reasons.

                                We currently use the following tools for data administration and provision (in particular, IP addresses, cookies, and log files):

                                If you deny the permission to use these tools, we won’t be able to fulfill our contractual obligations and will have to offer you the solutions that would be less effective.

                                To carry out software development and provide support, we cooperate with service providers located in Ukraine. Your data therefore can be transferred to Ukraine and stored there on the servers of ADVASoft GmbH. There are contracts between the responsible party and these service providers, regulating rights, obligations, and personal data protection measures. Data transfer to any other providers or storage locations in other countries outside the European Union does not take place.
